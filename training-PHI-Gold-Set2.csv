Har is a 43 year old 6' 214 pound gentleman who is referred for
consultation by Dr. Harlan Oneil.  About a week ago he slipped on
the driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle. 
He was seen at Tri-City Hospital and was told he had a
fracture.  He was placed in an air splint and advised to be
partial weight bearing, and he is using a cane.  He is here for
routine follow-up. 
Past medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously. 
He has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea.  He takes Prozac,
Cardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl.  He is also followed by Dr. Harold
Nutter for an arrhythmia.  He does not smoke.  He drinks
minimally.  He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures.
 
On examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle
about four fingerbreadths above the malleolus.  The malleolus is
non-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness
either.  Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain. 
There is no significant swelling.  There are no some skin changes
with some small abrasions proximally.  There is no fibular
tenderness proximally.  No anterior pain is noted.  No hindfoot,
midfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted. 
I would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast.  He is
using a cane for ambulation.  His x-rays do not show a notable
fracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion. 
I would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock.  I will
see him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office. 
 
 
Diagnosis:  Left ankle fracture.

                     CAMPBELL EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

VALDEZ,HARLAN,JR.   845-41-54-4                VISIT DATE: 03/14/08

The patient was seen and examined in the emergency department.  The 

patient was seen by the Emergency Medicine resident.  I have 

discussed the management with the resident.  I have also seen the 

patient primarily and reviewed the medical record.  This is a brief 

addendum to the medical record.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 45-year-old 

male who complains of several days of nausea, vomiting, and left 

lower quadrant discomfort.  He also describes intermittent chest 

pain, which he has had for a number of months without significant 

change.  He was sent in from his primary care doctor today with 

this pain and was also noted to have some EKG changes.  The patient 

has no chest pain at the time of evaluation in the emergency 

department and no shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is very 

well-appearing, a smiling, very pleasant gentleman in no acute 

distress.  The blood pressure is 119/90, the pulse 82, and the 

temperature 97.9 degrees.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  The chest 

is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rate and rhythm. 

The abdomen is soft.  He has left lower quadrant tenderness.  He 

also, of note on cardiovascular examination, has a soft murmur 

which he says he has had since childhood.  The extremities are 

normal.  The neurologic examination is non-focal. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This is a gentleman with abdominal 

pain who will receive a CAT scan to rule out diverticulitis.  He 

has also had some non-specific ST changes on his EKG.  He is 

pain-free at this time.  He does not describe a classic exertional 

pattern for his chest pain, but given that he is a diabetic and 

with EKG changes, he will also be admitted for rule out MI.  A CT 

is pending at the time of this dictation.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above.  The 

patient's condition is currently stable.

Vicente Blair, M.D.

RE: VALDEZ, Harlan 
DHN#: 7672624 
DATE OF BIRTH: 11/09/2062 
CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 
 
Dear Vicente, 
 
Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year. He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer. In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.  
 
He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses. He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep. He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties.   
He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.  
 
Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas. In addition, loud snoring was noted.  
 
There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes. There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep. There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study. In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.  
 
The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm. Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes). There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep"".  
 
Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"". The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general. As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.  
 
Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology). The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day"".  If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.  
 
The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  
1. Provigil 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. PRN.  
2. Lithium.  
3. Valproate.  
4. Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d.  
5. Humulin 15 units at night.  
6. Folate.  
7. Metoprolol.  
8. Cardia.  
9. Vitamin E.  
10. Coated aspirin.  
 
ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.   
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage. He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years. His current weight is 195 pounds. He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.  
 
On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.  
 
HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.  
 
The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact. He is presently wearing dental braces. No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated. No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted. No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present. No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted.  
 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep. These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).  
2. Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea. The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm). In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success. One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above.  3. Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem. While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.  
 
PLAN:  
1. In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.  q. h.s. PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.  
2. The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.  
3. The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.  
Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms). If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.  
4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.  
5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).   
Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez. I hope this letter finds you well.  
 
Sincerely yours,

4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.  
5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).   
Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. [PATIENT]. I hope this letter finds you well.  
 
Sincerely yours,

CCU JAR Transfer Note

Admission Date: 10/8/11

Transfer: 10/10/11

Patient Name: Valdez, Harlan 

MRN#: 7672624

Cardiologist:  Dr. Nutter

PCP:  Vicente Barker



CC: Chest Pain    Cath    VF arrest    RCA stenting



History of Present Illness (obtained on admission):  Pt is a 48 yo male with h/o DMII, hypercholesterolemia, Bipolar d/o, and depression who began to have sub-sternal day prior to admission in car and pre-syncope + profound weakness.  This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over.  He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission.  His EKG c/w 2/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL. His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated.  Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.  



Cath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 40%, LAD clear, RCA prox 70-80% lesion and ostial PDA 90%.  During final dye injection, pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks.  Pt regained puls and was in AF (new) with RVR. Pt was started on amio.  Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene.  POBA was done to ostial PDA.  A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed.  On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).  He was on amio drip, BB, loaded on plavix, ASA, lipitor, integrilin and was placed on Avandia study.  His complaint of some mild chest pain (not same as anginal pain day before) thought to be from defibrillation.

MRI L/S spine: negative



IMPRESSION:

49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, DM, Bipolar disorder, afib, s/p recent cardiac cath who presents w/ LUE weakness 10d prior to admission resolving after 4-5 days, and RLE weakness?/sensory deficit? Imaging reveals R precentral gyrus small infarct, L cerebellar infarct, no significant vessel stenoses.  Neuro exam w/ brisker reflexes on R, equivocal RLE weakness, R sensory sx, ? R upgoing toe.  Clinical picture and imaging are not consistent.  Unclear if pt is a poor historian and current sx are non-objective sensory findings and meaningful event was LUE weakness 4-5d ago.

NEURO: stroke w/u including TTE/Holter, lipids/lipoprotein/homocysteine.  

--Will also send hypercoag w/u (including hypercoag panel, PT20210, Factor V Leiden, APLA, lupus anticoagulant) given hx of retinal venous thrombus and young age.

--Will also send BCx2 given recent cardiac cath, although ESR wnl reassuring re ? of endocarditis.

--Will check A1c re ? of adequate DM control.

--Given psych hx, will check tox screen and LFT's.

--Unclear if afib was only in context of post-cath, post Vfib.  Will look for LAE, holter abnl.  Could make a case to anti-coagulate regardless as has had documented afib.  

CV: hold anti-htn meds now.  Continue lipitor at outpt dose.  Allow SBP up to 180.

PSYCH: continue w/ depakote and lithium.  Mood is ok now, but will need to be monitored.

FEN: no IVF, ada 1800 low chol/low fat diet.  

ENDO: NPH 20 bid for now, titrate up as needed, RISS.  Checking A1c.

PPX: put on sc fragmin, nexium.  Pneumoboots.

Russell, Donna

05/12/79


Ms. Russell comes in for further evaluation.  She has been in Rhode Island for 
six months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She 
does not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is 
associated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  
She does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in 
her chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.

She has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has 
hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health 
maintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She 
needs to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most 
concerned about her chest heaviness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is 
20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  
Chest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is 
regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and 
nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise 
within normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We 
sent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with 
nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise 
tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a 
maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 
seconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	Chest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a 
primary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one 
week.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal 
exercise tolerance test.
2.	Hypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.  Continue same 
dose of Synthroid.
3.	Hypertension, well controlled presently.
4.	Hyperlipidemia.  We will recheck this on her next visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell is returning for follow 
up.  She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar 
sensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she 
gets some pressure in her chest.  She gets a slight shortness of 
breath.  It lasts 30 seconds.  She gets as many as three or four 
a day.  The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling 
better and better, as she begins to lose some weight.  I think 
weight loss is going to be critical.  She also is less fatigued 
as she begins to lose weight.

Her hypertension has been under better control.  
Hydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition 
to the atenolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.  Weight has gone 
from 200 to 196 pounds.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Pulse is 64.  
Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to 
percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is regularly regular 
with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  
There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1.	Hypertension.  Relatively well controlled on 
hydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.
2.	Weight.  Now began to lose some weight and feeling much 
better as a result of it.
3.	Peculiar chest pressure.  I do not think she has coronary 
artery disease given the exercise test.  In light of this, 
we will try to control her blood pressure and get her to 
lose some weight.  Hopefully, this will help with the 
resolution of her symptoms.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.  
She has been doing very well.  She has been exercising and has lost from 
200 to 170 pounds.  She is feeling very well.

Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.  He did not find the 
first ETT acceptable.  The second ETT was grossly positive.  As a result 
of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
nitrate.  She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
pain that she was having before when she went up steps.

She did have hyperlipidemia.  We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
provided some control.  However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
is not an excellent ratio.  Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
limits.

She also has right shoulder lipoma.  This has become apparent since she 
lost so much weight.  She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
recommended Dr. Dawson.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.  Neck is supple.  There 
is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  
Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  
Abdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  
Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  None today.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	CAD.  We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.  I also 
gave her nitroglycerine.  We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
continue her atenolol.  She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
Premarin and Synthroid.
2.	Weight loss.  She will continue to exercise.  I suspect she is going 
to lose more weight.  This is excellent.
3.	Coronary artery disease.  Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
cardiac catheterization.  It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.  She is going to 
delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
done on this variety of medical issues.

November 25, 2123



Interim History:	

Comes to review diabetes and related problems.

He feels that he gets tired and needs to rest more after doing any exercise. He denies shortness of breath or chest pain, but he is not just describing generalized fatigue in that this is clearly related to physical exercise. He has not had an ETT since April, 2122.

Home Blood Tests:  

B 	103-149

L	not testing

S	not testing

HS	150-175, about 2pc



Retinopathy:	Sees Dr. Dailey each January. In January, he had very mild diabetic retinopathy and slight macular degeneration.

Nephropathy:	Due for microalbumin/creatinine ratio; normal in past.

Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.

Cardiac:	above; has seen Dr. Brian recently.

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Has had flu shot this year.

He told me in 2119 that he had had a PneumoVax, but did not know exactly when.



Social History: 

His wife has had walking difficulty after radiation therapy for her gynecologic malignancy. She sees Dr. YAEL Pratt.



Social History:

He retired. A new management gave him 3 hours to decide whether to retire or to work nights.



Review of Systems: above



Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   126/60		P:   72, regular	

Wt:   148.5 without shoes, down 17 since May !

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	Trace edema.         DP absent R, 1+ L.   PT absent.   There is an area at medial tip of L great toe with ? underlying dark blood and overlying callus that is of concern.



Impressions and Plan:	

Would check some BS before supper as well.

I have several concerns:

Could his exercise-induced fatigue be an angina-equivalent? Will defer to Dr. Brian with respect to the need for another ETT.

His weight loss continues, without explanation. Dr. Chandler is aware of this.

His L great toe is of concern. Dr. Aldridge has been following this area and he will continue to follow-up with him.

September 28, 2124



Interim History:	

Comes to review diabetes and related problems.

He had L THR in April

Has gained some weight since the surgery.

However, he reports that his BS are erratic despite a good diet and good appetite. He has had some symptoms of hypoglycemia in the late morning. He has checked his BS at that time and has found BS in the 70's-90's. 

Home Blood Tests:  

B 	87-140's, and occasionally in the 200's, which he attributes to    bad food    the previous evening. 

Retinopathy:	He has seen Dr. Dailey within a month or so. Again going next week. He has had a Bell's palsy by report. It has improved very significant ly. 

Nephropathy:	Due for microalbumin/creatinine ratio; normal in past.

Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.

Cardiac:	No chest pain. No unusual dyspnea on exertion though he does have stable dyspnea on exertion doing activities in the house. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: He is on more insulin than he was prior to his hip surgery.



Social History: 

He is planning to return to work as a printing press operator. He thinks that he can handle it and gets to sit down a lot.

His wife has been having problems with what he thinks to be complications of radiation therapy for gynecologic cancer.



Review of Systems: above



Physical Exam:	

He walks with a cane. Looks pretty frail but his mind is alert.

BP:   140/64		P:   68, regular	

Wt:   164 without shoes, up 15 since March

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Neck:	No JVD

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Normal S1; ? paradoxical S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	Trace ankle edema.        DP trace R, 1+ L. PT absent R, 1+ L.    There is a heel ulcer of L but the crust appears to be separating leaving healthy skin underneath.

Neurological:	AJ absent. Vibration sense moderately-severely reduced at the great toes. 



Impressions and Plan:	

Test BS QID a couple of days per week rather than every morning.

Reduce the NPH to 15 U and try to keep diet pretty uniform.

Call Ann Vandenberg if having any symptoms of hypoglycemia or BS<90.

Bring the heel ulcer to Dr. Chandler's attention when he sees him next week.

Be sure that he gets a flu shot.

RE:  Bruce Corona

FHC Unit #:  795-76-17



Dear Dunham:



I had the pleasure of seeing  Bruce Corona in the Cardiology Department office for a f/u visit.  Since I last saw him, he continues to complain of dyspnea.  An ETT was negative for ischemia.  PFTs were not really useful.  CT of the chest showed scarring/fibrosis.  His NT-proBNP has been on the marginal side, though he is without evidence for overt CHF.



Medications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Flomax 0.4 mg qd, Lopressor 25 mg bid, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Lisinopril 20 mg qd, Colace 100 mg tid.



Physical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 120/70 and his heart rate is 60 and regular. He is 170 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.  His sternotomy is healing well and is stable.  His apical impulse is non-displaced with a slightly irregular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2.  He has an S3 gallop.  No murmur.  His abdomen is benign without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta.  There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.



EKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.  He has a LBBB, which is chronic.



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p MI: currently stable.



2. Hypertension: under good control.



3.Hypercholesterolemia: controlled



4. Dyspnea: I suspect he has an element of diastolic dysfunction.  I will restart low-dose lasix.



Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in his care.



With best regards,



Bruce D. Brian, Jr., M.D.

come to the emergency room for evaluation.  The patient denies 

taking any nitroglycerin and denies any chest pain episodes since 

her stent was placed back in November 2067.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient had some midsternal chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for oral hypoglycemic requiring 

diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, 

and hypothyroidism.  Past surgeries and procedures include stent 

placement for an LAD lesion back in November 2067.

Attending:			Anaya

PCP:				Dr. Mia Tapia (Legacy Center)



Reason for admission to CCU:  

45 yo F w/ h/o DM, HTN, hypertriglyceridemia, tobacco use p/w SSCP and inferior STEMI. Treated w/ Reteplase for successful resolution of STE.

     

HPI: 

Pt with above CVD risk factors and HCV developed ""10/10"" SSCP/pressure accompanied by nausea and diaphoresis while at rest evening of admission at approximately 11 PM. Pain had no radiation to back, jaw, L arm. Pt had no syncope, palpitations, light headedness. EMS activated and initial vitals P 62 BP 124/palp RR 16. Described as pale, dry. STE noted in inferior leads, V4R not elevated. Pt provided w/ ASA, TNG spray and 250 cc bolus. 



In ED, T 96.1 P 60 BP 75/45 RR 18. Provided ASA 325, heparin bolus at 5000U and 1000 U/hour, MSO4. STE noted inferiorly.

Imaging:

CXR - poor inspiration, low lung volumes w/ soft tissue, mild cardiomegaly, early failure.



EKG:



5/15/97 02:37

Sinus brady w/ rate 50; inferior STE, 1-2 mm; biphasic apical TWI; lateral TWI, likely reciprocal changes; slight LAE.



Assessment/Plan:



45 yo F with multiple medical problems, particularly obesity, tobacco history, DM presenting with significant EKG changes in inferior distribution. Because the cath lab was occupied, ward cardiology opted to forego delay and treated her with Reteplase x 2 with excellent results, including resolution of symptoms and resolution of EKG changes.



1.	Ischemia.

Now on plavix, statin. 

Has received ASA several times during this evaluation. Allergy is GI upset. Clarify with aim of continuing daily ASA for vascular prophylaxis.

Continue heparin peri-event period.

Needs ACE I for remodeling as well as risk reduction as pt has DM.

She merits further definition of her coronary anatomy by catheterization in 1-2 days. Lysis has risk of restenosis, plus may have additional lesion of borderline significance.

High risk for post-lytic restenosis; follow daily EKG, symptoms, markers.

If pt unwilling to undergo cath, then echo plus stress test for characterization of risk stratification.



2.	Pump.

Slightly volume overloaded, can administer lasix 20 IV now.

Echo to evaluate post-event remodeling, define anatomy and physiology.

Advance lopressor as tolerated.



3.	DM.

Checking sugars QID. Holding hypoglycemics.

She will require tight control peri-infarct.

	Cont medications for glaucoma.



4.	Psychiatric.

Pt's out-pt regimen will be maintained during this hospitalization. No indication for psychiatric consult.



5.	Hypothyroidism.

Maintain on current dosage of levoxyl w/out checking TFTs during hospitalization.



6.	Chronic pain.

Cont neurontin.

Provide low-dose narcotic as previously scheduled on out-pt med list.

7.	Prophylaxes.

Nexium; on heparin post-event.

Assessment/Plan:



[AGE] yo F with multiple medical problems, particularly obesity, tobacco history, DM presenting with significant EKG changes in inferior distribution. Because the cath lab was occupied, ward cardiology opted to forego delay and treated her with Reteplase x 2 with excellent results, including resolution of symptoms and resolution of EKG changes.



1.	Ischemia.

Now on plavix, statin. 

Has received ASA several times during this evaluation. Allergy is GI upset. Clarify with aim of continuing daily ASA for vascular prophylaxis.

Continue heparin peri-event period.

Needs ACE I for remodeling as well as risk reduction as pt has DM.

She merits further definition of her coronary anatomy by catheterization in 1-2 days. Lysis has risk of restenosis, plus may have additional lesion of borderline significance.

High risk for post-lytic restenosis; follow daily EKG, symptoms, markers.

If pt unwilling to undergo cath, then echo plus stress test for characterization of risk stratification.



2.	Pump.

Slightly volume overloaded, can administer lasix 20 IV now.

Echo to evaluate post-event remodeling, define anatomy and physiology.

Advance lopressor as tolerated.



3.	DM.

Checking sugars QID. Holding hypoglycemics.

She will require tight control peri-infarct.

	Cont medications for glaucoma.



4.	Psychiatric.

Pt's out-pt regimen will be maintained during this hospitalization. No indication for psychiatric consult.



5.	Hypothyroidism.

Maintain on current dosage of levoxyl w/out checking TFTs during hospitalization.



6.	Chronic pain.

Cont neurontin.

Provide low-dose narcotic as previously scheduled on out-pt med list.

7.	Prophylaxes.

Nexium; on heparin post-event.

Dr. Mabel Duvall 

Medicine Department 

Bellflower Doctors Hospital 

 

 

RE:  TUTTLE, Sandy 

MR#:  2793372 

DOB:  January 16, 2082 

 

 

Dear Dr. Duvall:  

 

Thank you for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  I understand that he is referred here for evaluation of polyneuropathy.  

 

Mr. Tuttle is a 63-year-old right-handed diabetic man who has developed numbness of his lower extremities since 2125.  The numbness started in his toes and gradually spread proximally up to the level of the knees.  In 2135, the numbness started to affect his hands.  In 2139, the patient noted atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous muscles of both hands, left worse than right.  

 

The patient denies any pain in his legs or feet.  He has a five year history of localized low back pain and neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity all the way down to his hands.  In 2125, the patient fell down a ladder from a height of about 30 feet.  According to the patient, he herniated a cervical disk, but surgery was not indicated.  He remembers having pain in his left elbow and neck after the fall.  

 

The patient developed impotence and constipation in 2130.  In 2139, he started to have symptoms of orthostatic hypotension which he described as feeling light-headed, darkening of vision upon standing.  The patient also noted gait imbalance in 2139 prior to his retirement in 2141.  

 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes since 2123, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, constipation, impotence, macular degeneration of the eyes, retinopathy, s/p laser treatments, history of neck pain and low back pain as mentioned above, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, skin problems using a number of steroid creams, penile implant in 2130.  

 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, Diltiazem, Zestril, Mevacor, steroid creams, Colace, metoclopramide, Naprosyn, insulin.   



ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  

 

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married he has two daughters, 30 and 40 years of age.  He used to work as a Legal Secretary until he retired in December of 2141.  The patient quit smoking in 2107.  He denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.  

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of unclear cause at the age of 45.  His father was diabetic and had heart problems.  Mother died in her 30's.  The patient does not know the cause of death.  The patient had one brother who died in his 50's from diabetic complications.  He had two sister who died of diabetic complications.  Of his two living sisters, one of them is also a diabetic.  The patient's daughters are not diabetic.  There is no known family history of neuromuscular disorders.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Range of motion of the neck is limited.  Head turning 45 degrees to either side.  Limited neck extension.  Negative straight-leg raising.  Negative spine tenderness.  Regular cardiac rhythm, no heart murmur.  Negative carotid bruits.  In the supine position, blood pressure 105/50, heart rate 60 and regular.  Upon standing, blood pressure dropped to 60/40, heart rate remained 60.  The patient was asymptomatic.   



NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Alert, coherent and appropriate.  The patient knows the name of his physician, Dr. Duvall, Dr. Villagomez, and Dr. Goldberg at Pioneer Home.  

 

Cranial nerves:  Visual fields full.  Visual acuity with reading glasses 20/30 on the right, 20/20 -1 on the left.  Extraocular movements full.  No nystagmus.  Pupils sluggishly reactive to light.  Optic discs flat bilaterally.  No facial asymmetry.  The tongue and soft palate move symmetrically.  

 

Motor examination:  Atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous and ADM, worse on the left hand.  No atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis.  Negative arm drift.  Motor strength testing 5/5 in all muscles of both upper extremities except for 4/5 weakness of the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi bilaterally.  No weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis on either hand.  Motor strength testing of the lower extremities 5/5 except for mild weakness of toe extensors 4+/5 bilaterally.  The patient was able to walk on his toes and heels while holding onto the examiner.  Deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and knees.  Absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  Toes downgoing.  No spasticity of the lower extremities.

   

Sensory examination:  Significant for absent pin prick sensation in both feet up to the level of the knees.  Pin prick sensation is diminished in the dorsal aspect of all fingers and the palmar aspect of both hands.  Vibratory sensation absent in the toes, intact at the ankles and knees bilaterally.  Intact vibratory sensation in the upper extremities.  Romberg test significant for body swaying, but the patient did not fall.  Tandem gait was poor, but improved when holding the examiner.  No limb ataxia.   



LABORATORY DATA:  Review of previous laboratory tests of May, 2145, BUN 36, creatinine 1.7, glucose 310.  December, 2144, TSH normal.  October, 2143, B12 normal.  Negative RPR.  The patient said he was tested negative for HIV in 2142, and 2143.  MRI of the brain in 2142 and 2143 revealed bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemisphere without any intracranial mass lesion.   



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, we have a 63-year-old diabetic man who appears to have significant sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic involvement.  He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.  



As we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.  He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.  The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.  

 

MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.  The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.  He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.  

 

The patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.  

 

Thank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  

 

Sincerely, 

 

 

 

Stanly Lang, M.D.

Reason for consult:  65 year old man with progressive LBP, found to have heterogeneous marrow on MRI, we have been consulted to help evaluate, possibly perform a bone marrow biopsy.



HPI:

65 yo male with PMH significant for DM, autonomic dysfunction, CRI, depression and arthritis who was admitted for progressive lower back pain.  He has had LBP for at least three years which is located in his mid lumbar region, non radiating, worse with standing.  The pain had progressed such that he has a very poor performance status. He cannot stand but for a few minutes at a time.  He denies focal wekness.   He had an MRI of the LS spine 2/02/47 which revealed heterogeneous marrow concernig for an infiltrating process in his marrow.   He has had an SPEP which was normal, he has had a bone scan which was negatvie. He does not have an elevated protein or globulin fraction. His CRI is longstanding  and attributed to his DM.  He was set up for a outpt BM bx to evaluate the marrow process, but the pain has been so severe, he was admitted for an inpatient work up.  Of note he has longstanding anemia related to his CRI, perhaps anemia of chronic disease.  He denies any weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, decreased appetite. He does report fatigue which has become progressive.

MRI 1/47: heterogenous bonemarrow uptake in vertebrae and pelvis, concerning for infiltrative process



Imp/Plan:

Mr. Tuttle is a 65 year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature. The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.  He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow. They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process. He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM. We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out. Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.  In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically. Is any of this TB?  Recommend:

-- skeletal survey

-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas

-- beta-2 microglobulin

-- reticulocyte count

-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco

-- guaiac all stools

-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential

-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today. 

-- Will review smear and staff with Dr. Landry in the afternoon.

Thank you for this consult.

MRI [DATE]: heterogenous bonemarrow uptake in vertebrae and pelvis, concerning for infiltrative process



Imp/Plan:

Mr. [PATIENT] is a [AGE] year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature. The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.  He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow. They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process. He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM. We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out. Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.  In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically. Is any of this TB?  Recommend:

-- skeletal survey

-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas

-- beta-2 microglobulin

-- reticulocyte count

-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco

-- guaiac all stools

-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential

-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today. 

-- Will review smear and staff with Dr. [DOCTOR] in the afternoon.

Thank you for this consult.

Record date: 2148-02-10

REASON FOR VISIT:  Followup for diabetic cheiropathy.  Rule out other diabetes-related musculoskeletal syndrome.  Monitoring of Ultracet therapy and left shoulder injection.  

 

INTERVAL HISTORY:  Left shoulder injection was helpful but only last short time.  Just  a week or so.  Ultracet was relieving pains but was not able to afford it.  Feels stable and not worse since last seen.  Telling me he is cutting down his medications and he is letting his doctors know about this. No acute swelling or further different joint complaints other than what was described in my previous notes.  Rest of review of systems again unchanged.   



MEDICATIONS:  The medication file is same as last time, except for addition of Tylenols now.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: BP 100/70.  Other VS WNL. Wt. 170lb.  Gait:  Slow.  Cooperative.  VSS.  HEENT:  Halitosis.  Poor teeth hygiene.  Lungs:  Clear.  Heart:  Unremarkable.  Abdomen exam:  Slight sensitiveness in epigastrium.  A little low-frequency tremor in extremities.  Musculoskeletal examination:  Both shoulders with limited ROM.  Left shoulder active ROM is improved compared to the last description.  Hands with prayer's sign present.  Elbows again show lesser degree of flexion contracture.  Range of motion in both shoulders diminished, 

more in the left side.  Hardening of skin on the palm side of hands.  Has atrophy of intrinsic muscles of hands.  The rest of joint examination, free of inflammation.  Unchanged from last description.  

 

IMPRESSION:  Diabetic cheiropathy.  Rule out other diabetes-related musculoskeletal syndrome esp in shoulders.  Helped by Ultracet.  Osteoarthritis changes of early stage.  Status post olecranon bursitis.  Elevated creatinine.  

 

PLANS:  

1.  Continue Ultracet up 2 tablets prn once     twice a day; Samples given.

2.  May consider low-dose narcotics, given his multiple comorbidity and sensitive renal function to nonsteroidal therapy.  3.  Close followup for diabetes care with other physicians.   

DISPOSITION:  Followup in 4 months or so.

A/P: Cath pending. Cont ASA. Would recheck fasting cholesterol and change to lipitor 80 qd for maximal risk factor management. Limited in use of BB, ACE with orthostatic hypotension. 

Orthostatic hypotension

Fairly severe orthostasis, likely secondary to autonomic dysfunction from diabetes.  Continues to c/o dizziness + nausea with prolonged standing. On fludrocortisone 1x/d, midodrine 10 TID, occ wearing TED stockings. 

A/P: Encourage H2O intake. Needs TED stockings. Continue fludrocortisone 0.1 mg/d, may need to decrease midodrine.

Renal insufficiency

Patient has a h/o DM and CRI. Baseline Cr ranges from 2-3, but went as low as 1.4 in the hospital with hydration. Est CrCl around 28. Ulytes c/w renal disease. Nephrologist Dr. Nesmith. He tries he drinks 6 8 oz glasses of water qd but sometimes doesn't drink as much as that.

Assessment and plan   1. CAD: NSTEMI, on ASA, heparin, statin. 2b3a to start, cath pending in AM. Would recheck fasting cholesterol and change to lipitor 80 qd for maximal risk factor management. Be VERY CAUTIOUS in use of BB, ACE with orthostatic hypotension (he has supine HTN but is extremely orthostatic when he stands up).

- cards consult appreciated

- bedrest x 24h

- increase BB; hold ACE with pending cath.

- pls repeat TTE as per cards

- fasting chol pending; inc lipitor to 80 qd.



2. BP: orthostatic hypotension/supine hypertension

- d/c midodrine, florinef

- BP control with BB (he will NOT be able to go home on this), IV TNG + nitropaste as needed.



3. CRI: DM + chronic prerenal. Continue hydration with IVF o/n.

- mucomyst, hold ACE.



4. DM: on  Insulin 75/25, 28 qA, 26qP. Continue QID FS, adjust as needed. Pls resend HbA1c and get a nutrition consult. I am concerned that he is on too much regular insulin causing his nightsweats and his low glc at FCH yesterday. He may need to change back to NPH and regular (was difficult in the past 2/2 poor vision and arthritis).



5. constipation: pls increase bowel regimen (currently on miralax + colace).



6. PT consult please. He will likely need rehab.



Thanks for the excellent care! I will continue to follow with you.

Assessment and plan   1. CAD: NSTEMI, on ASA, heparin, statin. 2b3a to start, cath pending in AM. Would recheck fasting cholesterol and change to lipitor 80 qd for maximal risk factor management. Be VERY CAUTIOUS in use of BB, ACE with orthostatic hypotension (he has supine HTN but is extremely orthostatic when he stands up).

- cards consult appreciated

- bedrest x 24h

- increase BB; hold ACE with pending cath.

- pls repeat TTE as per cards

- fasting chol pending; inc lipitor to 80 qd.



2. BP: orthostatic hypotension/supine hypertension

- d/c midodrine, florinef

- BP control with BB (he will NOT be able to go home on this), IV TNG + nitropaste as needed.



3. CRI: DM + chronic prerenal. Continue hydration with IVF o/n.

- mucomyst, hold ACE.



4. DM: on  Insulin 75/25, 28 qA, 26qP. Continue QID FS, adjust as needed. Pls resend HbA1c and get a nutrition consult. I am concerned that he is on too much regular insulin causing his nightsweats and his low glc at [HOSPITAL] yesterday. He may need to change back to NPH and regular (was difficult in the past 2/2 poor vision and arthritis).



5. constipation: pls increase bowel regimen (currently on miralax + colace).



6. PT consult please. He will likely need rehab.



Thanks for the excellent care! I will continue to follow with you.

                                                NIHC #:	981-40-48

PROGRESS NOTE					DOB:		







Quiana is a 72-year-old woman who comes in for follow-up of her hypertension.  Please see her current medication list.  She also has a history of diabetes.  



Over the past few weeks to one month she has been having intermittent right shoulder pain.  It is worse with lifting.  The pain is in her deltoid muscle and radiates a little bit across her upper back.  It is worse if she actually lies on her shoulder at night.  There is no history of trauma, no neck pain, no upper extremity numbness or weakness except for occasional left thumb numbness.  The thumb numbness resolves if she shakes her hand.



She is also having bilateral knee pain when she walks.  There is no swelling or effusion or heat in her knees.  She had been on Vioxx for her spinal stenosis but stopped it because it was not helping her spinal stenosis pain.  Instead for her shoulder pain she has been taking Advil 200 mg 2 and up to 6 per day. She takes the Advil with food or milk and is not having any GI upset from it.  



She is having a lot of stresses with her husband, whom she feels may have some early memory problems.  His mini-mental status on his last exam was a 30/40.  However, he makes, according to her, arbitrary decisions, does not complete projects he starts, and not as task-oriented as he used to be.  He does not complete tasks or shopping errands that she would like him to do.  We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level.  She does get very anxious and upset at times.  She had been considering taking Ativan p.r.n. when she gets very upset and frustrated.  She is also having stressors with her grandson, who lives next door and has a problem with substance abuse and questionable money issues.  



She denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or edema.  She is on her diabetes medication.  She likes going to work because that gets her out of the house.



ON EXAMINATION:  She is a pleasant, animated woman in no acute distress.  Her blood pressure initially was 160/80.  After discussing her situation with her husband, her blood pressure was 180/85.  Neck supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear without rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm and normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  She has no peripheral edema.

 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)	Hypertension, poor control.  Will increase her Zestril to 40 mg p.o. q.d.  Her daughter, Iyanna Field who is a registered nurse, will continue to monitor her blood pressure.  

(2)	Right shoulder pain.  On exam she has good range of motion of her shoulder and her muscle strength and reflexes are intact.  She can continue the Advil p.r.n. but should take it with antacids or something to protect her stomach.  



(3)	Adult-onset diabetes.  We will check her Hemoglobin A1c.  



She will follow up for her complete physical in May.

NAME:    Justus, Quiana
MRN:       9814048

Quiana is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes and spinal stenosis who
comes in for a physical.  She has spinal stenosis as documented by her prior MRI's. 
She can usually walk about 5 minutes and then develops pain in her thighs and
calves.  She has some knee pain with walking, but it is not consistent and does not
occur after short 5-minute distances.  The thigh and calf pain resolve with rest.  She
does not always have back pain with the thigh and calf pain.  She also has occasional
right lateral foot pain that feels like an achy arthritic pain in her foot.  She takes
Vioxx occasionally for that foot pain.  She does not have any dysesthesias or
numbness in her feet or hands.  She has no recent trauma, fevers or chills.  She has
no change in her bowel or bladder.

She has type 2 diabetes.  She has been taking Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.  Her weight is
stable.  She does get annual ophthalmology evaluations.  

She has a history of hypertension. She has not had any chest pain, PND, orthopnea,
dyspnea on exertion or edema.  Her blood pressure is never well controlled when she
comes for her visits here, but her daughter, Iyanna Field, a nurse takes her
blood pressure at home and she reports that it is typically 120/70.  She is currently on
Propranolol LA 160 2 tabs p.o. q.d., Dyazide 1 tab p.o. q.d., Captopril 50 mg t.i.d.

She has a history of hyperlipidemia.  She was intolerant of Lipitor in the past.  She
has been taking the Lopid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. without complications.  She does not do
regular breast self-exams but has not noted any masses.  She is status-post
menopause.  We discussed DEXA bone density scanning, but she did not want to do
it at this time.

We also discussed colon cancer screening.  For now she elects to do stool guaiacs x 3. 
She has not had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or hematochezia, abdominal
pain or weight loss.    

Please see her complete medication update in the LMR. 

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married.  She drinks occasional but not excessive alcohol. 
She does not smoke.  There is no history of domestic abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY: Please see family history update in the LMR.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.

She has not had a recent tetanus shot.

PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure here is 150/90.  Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear
without wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Her breasts are without masses or adenopathy. 
Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or
murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  She is
moderately obese.  Her rectal exam is without masses.  She has no spinal tenderness
on palpation.  Her lower extremity strength is 5/5.  She does not have any peripheral
edema.  Her distal pulses are 2+.  Her sensation is intact to light touch in her feet.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking.  This is probably due to her
     spinal stenosis.  However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes,
     hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  We will check lower extremity noninvasive
     arterial studies to rule out claudication.  She can take the Vioxx p.r.n. for her
     foot pain which I do not think is related.

(2)  Type 2 diabetes.  She needs a hemoglobin A1c.  Her blood pressure ideally
     should be under 130/85.  She reports that it is consistently below that level
     when her daughter checks it.  She needs as chem-7.  She has no evidence for
     neuropathy at this time.

(3)  Health maintenance.  She needs a tetanus shot which she was given today. 
     Will check stool guaiacs x 3.  

We discussed calcium supplementation for osteoporosis prevention.  She will follow
up in six months and p.r.n.  She has not had a recent tetanus shot. She was given a
tetanus shot in the left deltoid without complications.

NAME:    Justus, Quiana

MRN:     9814048



The patient comes in today for follow up of several medical problems. She has a

history of type 2 diabetes. Her sugars have not been optimally controlled. They are

usually in the 190-200 range in the morning. Her weight is stable. She has no lower

extremity numbness or weakness.  



She has a history of hyperlipidemia. She stopped her Lescol 2 weeks ago because it

was expensive. She also never increased the dose above 20 mg. She has had side

effects with atorvastatin and pravastatin in the past. Please see her allergy list in

LMR.



She has a half sister who had colon cancer at age 88. Quiana has had rare

occasional blood streaking when she wipes herself after being constipated. She is

aware of what a colonoscopy is but absolutely refuses a colonoscopy. She is aware

that she is at increased risk for colon cancer given her family history. She has no

nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or weight loss.



She has chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain that is probably due to spinal

stenosis. She has lower back pain and pain in her legs that is worse with walking. It

helps when she uses a carriage to walk around in the store. She denies lower

extremity numbness, change in her bowel or bladder, fevers or chills. Her last MRI

was done in Walsenburg in a wide body machine and was consistent with spinal stenosis. 

She has taken Ultram. She is aware that Vioxx may increase people's risk for cardiac

disease and has stopped taking it. Dr. Yeager, her rheumatologist, referred her to Dr.

North in Internal Medicine for possible injections. 



PHYSICAL EXAM: No acute distress. Her blood pressure is 180/90. However, her

daughter,Iyanna Field, checks her blood pressure at home and it is very well controlled. 

The patient gets very anxious here in the clinic. Neck supple without JVD or bruits.

Lungs clear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular,

normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or murmurs. No C/C/E. Distal pulses intact.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Type 2 diabetes. Check hemoglobin A1c. Continue current medications.



(2)  Hyperlipidemia. She should be on medication to keep her LDL below 100. She

     said that she would resume the medication.



(3)  Hypertension which is never well controlled on her visits here. Her daughter is

     a nursing professional and does report that her blood pressure is very well controlled

     in the 120/80 range when she checks at home. We will continue her current

     regimen.



(4)  Lower back pain. Probably secondary to spinal stenosis. She has an

     appointment with Dr. North.

CCU Admission Note
Patient Name: Justus, Quiana
MR# 9814048
Location: Internal Medicine
PCP: Xayachack, Ida, M.D.
Date of Admission: 3/18/91
CC: STEMI


HPI: 
79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI. It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday. She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV. She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress. ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection. Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16. 


On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow. Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most. LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.


A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.


On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr. Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012. Her Temp. was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission. She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K. Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP. Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr. When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin. The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

EKG in ED at 7.31AM: RAD, VT, STE in I, aVL, V5,V6
EKG on CCU Admission: NSR at 113 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, 2-3 mm in II,III, AvF
Repeat EKG 9 hours after CCU Admission: NSR at 99 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, II,III, AvF resolving.


Impression:
79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with lateral STEMI with occluded OM1, s/p BM stent and is now in cardiogenic and septic shock.


Plan: 
1.        CV Pump: cardiogenic shock: continue vasopressor and inotrope support with Dobutamine, Levophed, Vasopressin, goal to wean Levophed to reduce afterload and increase CI, continue to give fluid boluses intermittently as she appeared preload dependent possibly due to RV involvement, MAP goal above 65, goal to keep CI above 2.2, f/u urine output with goal to keep above 25, trending lactic acid
2.        CV Ischemia: STEMI, cont. ASA, Plavix, Heparin, Reopro, holding BB and ACE in setting of hypotension, will check HbA1c
3.        CV Rhythm: currently NSR, on Tele
4.        Septic shock: aspiration event vs. possibly CAP, no evidence of other infectious source, covering empirically with Vancomycin/Levaquin IV given absence of recent hospitalization over the past 90 days, checking C.diff, will have low threshold to broaden coverage further if necessary
5.        HTN: currently hypotensive, holding BP meds
6.        DM: holding Metformin, RISS
7.        FEN: NPO for now with NGT on continous suctioning
8.        Prophylaxis: Heparin IV, PPI IV bid
9.        Code Status: Full Code 
10.   Dispo: pending resolution of acute medical issues

CCU Admission Note
Patient Name: [PATIENT]
MR# [MEDICALRECORD]
Location: Internal Medicine
PCP: [DOCTOR], M.D.
Date of Admission: [DATE]
CC: STEMI


HPI: 
[AGE] yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI. It began last [DATE], when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by [DATE]. She apparently called EMS on [DATE] then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV. She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress. ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection. Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16. 


On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow. Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most. LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.


A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.


On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr. Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012. Her Temp. was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission. She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K. Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP. Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr. When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin. The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

Visit Note


Patient Name: JUSTUS, QUIANA                       MRN: 9814048
Dictated Date: 07/27/2091                      Dictated By: Ida Xayachack, M.D.


Date of Visit: 07/24/2091




The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease who comes in today for followup. Please see the recent note from cardiology from 06/27/2091. She is status post stenting in 03/2091 and 06/2091. Post her second procedure she also had a large hematoma which has been gradually resolving. 


She has type 2 diabetes and her fasting sugars have been very well controlled. She is currently on metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. and glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. She is trying to watch her diet and salt intake. She has not had any symptoms of hypoglycemia. She had lost some weight after her first heart attack but her weight has been stable. 


Her lisinopril was recently increased by cardiology. She has no exertional chest pain, PND, orthopnea, edema, or claudication. 


She has a history of iron deficiency anemia and had refused colonoscopies in the past. At the time of her heart attack she had been intubated and had some coffee grounds noted and also required a blood transfusion. She has not noted any epigastric pain, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia. She does take her iron supplements and her stools are dark on the iron supplements. I had discussed with patient and daughter several times that she should get a colonoscopy to evaluate her guaiac iron deficiency anemia but she continues to refuse one. 


Also noted on her admissions was that she had a lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass on CT from 03/2091 and 06/2091. She should get a repeat CT in 12/2091. 


She is not having any abdominal pain. 


She has chronic back pain and osteoarthritis pain. Of note she also had elevated parathyroid levels in the past but refuses to see Endocrinology either in Fayetteville or at United Methodist Behavioral Hospital. 


Please see her medication list which was reviewed with the patient and her daughter. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 132/70. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1 and S2. No S3, S4 or bruits. Abdomen: Mildly obese, soft, nontender. She still has some residual hematoma near her right groin. She has a left femoral artery bruit. The hematoma has significantly decreased in size compared to prior visit. No CCE. Distal pulses intact. 


1. Coronary artery disease. She has no symptoms of decompensated heart failure on her current regimen. Her blood pressure is well controlled with the recent increase in the lisinopril from 20 to 40 mg daily. Check Chem-7. 


Hypomagnesemia. Check followup magnesium level. 


Type 2 diabetes. Her last hemoglobin A1c was 6.1 which is excellent. Continue current medications. 
Iron deficiency anemia. She should have a colonoscopy +/- an upper endoscopy but she declines these procedures. She is aware that we have not ruled out colon cancer or adenomatous colonic polyps or other cause for her iron deficiency anemia. Check CBC. 


History of lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass versus IPMN. These were both stable on imaging from 03/2091 and 06/2091. She needs repeat imaging in 6 months. She will follow up with me in 10/2091 so we can get a flu shot and schedule these procedures.

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Anderson.

 PA's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by

me.  Please see the PA's note for details of the patient's past

medical, social, family history, review of systems, and physical

exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rash on legs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 79-year-old man brought in by his

family complaining of a pruritic rash on his bilateral ankles and

today, both ankles are slightly more swollen than usual.  He has

no difficulty breathing, no chest pain.  The patient used to live

in England 4 days ago, arrived in Frankenmuth to live now

permanently with his family here.  He has a history of ""heart

problems for which he is taking Lasix, enalapril, and amlodipine

and is compliant with these medications.  He says initially his

legs were not swollen.  It was only today that the family

happened to notice as he was complaining of a rash that he had

slightly increased swelling of these ankles bilaterally.  The

patient's daughter reports that she bought him new long underwear

and noticed that the rash began where the underwear elastic band

hit his ankles in that similar distribution, there is pruritus

with evidence of excoriation.  He also does have evidence of

chronic venous stasis changes in his legs.  The leg swelling is

equal bilaterally does not extend to the calf and is minimal. 

The patient reports that he coughs when he is out in the cold

Frankenmuth air, but does not produce any sputum.  Has baseline

orthopnea and PND of 3 pillows which has not changed.  He has had

no worsening shortness of breath and no chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, TIA.  He has

no history of DVT.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No significant surgical procedures.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker, does not drink or use

drugs.  Lives with his family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

ALLERGIES:  Has no allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, in no distress,

afebrile.  Normal and stable vital signs, saturating 96-97% on

room air.  His exam is unremarkable except for excoriation to the

bilateral ankles with chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally

and trace 1-2+ edema bilaterally equal and the ankles only down

to the mid foot.  He has strong and equal, 2+ dorsalis pedis

pulses in the feet.  The rest of his examination is unremarkable

with clear lungs and breath sounds.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient said has no plans to

get a doctor in America.  He filled out an application

for Frankenmuth Care on arrival to the Emergency Department.  I spoke

with him and his family at length about the need to immediately

get a primary care doctor.  He was given the numbers for the

Tobey Hospital and Heritage Residence.  He has about 3 weeks of his

medications left and he is told that he will need to see ____. 

The family understands the urgency of this situation.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Today is dermatitis.  He is told to continue

his medications as prescribed to elevate the feet to decrease the

swelling.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged in satisfactory condition to follow up

with the primary care physician.

I saw this patient with Dr. Queen Pickett.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

Please see the resident's note for further details.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncopal event.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male

with a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is on

Coumadin, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,

hypertension, and prior transient ischemic attack, who had a

syncopal episode yesterday.  As per report, the patient felt

lightheaded and passed out while he was shaving.  The patient

passed out while using in the bathroom.  The patient was actually

caught by son before he actually hit the floor.  The patient did

not strike his head.  There was no loss of consciousness.  The

patient then awoke once he was supine.  The patient later felt

normal.  The patient states that he did have some antecedent

diaphoresis and shortness of breath and possible chest

palpitations.  The patient states that he felt like something was

jumping inside his body.  The patient does complain of some

fatigue and malaise.  The patient denies having any lower

extremity swelling or pain.  The patient denies having any chest

pain at this time.  The patient did have an adenosine MIBI in

March 2095, which showed some areas of reversible ischemia over

the distribution of the left circumflex artery.  The patient's

transthoracic echocardiogram from March 2095 did show some LVH as

well as for an ejection fraction of 50% with some global

hypokinesis.  The patient was seen by his primary care physician,

specifically, Dr. Ross.  The patient was instructed to come to

the Emergency Department for further evaluation and admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed the

following:  The patient's temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Heart rate 63 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per

minute, blood pressure is 151/18, and oxygen saturation was

interpreted as normal.  General:  Mild-to-moderate discomfort

noted, daughter at bedside, pleasant.  HEENT:  The patient's head

is normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp hematomas.  Mucous

membranes were somewhat dry.  Posterior oropharynx was clear. 

Neck:  Supple, no JVD.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation

bilaterally.  No focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes. 

Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, distant heart sounds, no

definite murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.  GI: 

Abdomen:  Soft, no rebound or guarding, no focal tenderness to

palpation, no palpable pulsatile mass appreciated.  Rectal exam

deferred.  GU exam deferred.  Skin:  Warm and dry, no rash or

lesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral angle tenderness. 

There was no presacral edema.  Extremities:  Warm and well

perfused, trace lower extremity edema noted, no asymmetrical

lower extremity edema.  There were no palpable cords.  Neuro: 

The patient was alert and oriented x3, motor, strength, and

sensation were all grossly intact.  The patient's cranial nerves

are grossly intact.  I did not ambulate the patient.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 70-year-old male

with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart

failure, prior transient ischemic attack, and atrial fibrillation

for which he is on Coumadin, who presents with a syncopal

episode.  The patient was sent in to the Emergency Department for

further evaluation and workup for this syncopal event. 

Differential diagnosis at this time includes a syncopal event

secondary to dehydration versus arrhythmia.  I do not feel that

the patient had a cerebrovascular accident.  The patient will

need to have screening laboratory studies and formal imaging.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient then had a 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's

12-lead EKG was consistent with atrial fibrillation with some

T-wave flattening noted.  There were no definite acute ischemic

changes appreciated.  The patient had laboratory studies sent. 

The patient's laboratory studies were notable for a creatinine of

1.69.  The patient does have a history of renal insufficiency. 

The patient's cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's BNP

was elevated at 1380.  The patient's complete blood count was

normal.  The patient's coagulation studies were normal patient's

coagulation studies were notable for an INR of 2.2.  The patient

then had a noncontrast head CT scan performed.  The patient's

noncontrast head CT scan results are still pending at this time. 

The patient also had a 2-view chest x-ray ordered.  The patient's

chest x-ray results are also still pending at this time.  Dr.

Ross kindly and promptly saw the patient here in the Emergency

Department.  He was in agreement with admitting the patient to

Internal Medicine at this time.  The patient will be admitted

to a monitor bed.  The patient will need to rule out for possible

acute coronary syndrome or cardiac ischemia.  The patient will

need further monitoring for possible arrhythmia.  The patient was

in agreement with this plan for admission at this time.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Syncopal event, possibly secondary to an arrhythmia.

2.  Atrial fibrillation.

3.  Renal insufficiency.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine

and to a monitor bed.

CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable and satisfactory.

Dear Dr. Regan: 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Percy Root in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Shady Brook Hospital today.  As you know, he is a 70-year-old man who is s/p CABG in May of this year. Today he is doing well folloing his surgery . 



His past medical history is significant for a coronary artery disease, status post IMI,afib,  CABG, PPM,  hypertension, hyperlipidemia, question of an old stroke.  His current medications include aspirin 81 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, lisinorpill 40 mg, Toprol-XL 10 mg, Prilosec 20 mg, Zocor 40 mg, Hydralazine.Coumadin as directed.


Allergies:  No known drug allergies.


He lives in Claxton with his wife, daughter, and grandkids and son-in-law.  He does not drink, smoke or use IV drugs.  He is originally from England.  


Family History:  noncontributory.


On physical examination, his heart rate was 60 and regular,  his blood pressure was 125/70.  Carotids are 2+, good upstrokes, no bruits.  Jugular venous pressure was flat.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Abdomen was benign.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities. Good peripheral pulses.





In summary, this is a 70-year-old man with coronary artery disease,  At this time he is NYHA II. Hre appears a bit volume overloaded. I will add ACE and lasix. Follow up in 1 month.

 Attending Note


I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.  I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.


The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.  Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.  CTA was also normal.  He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past. Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.  His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.  It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;


The exam today showed:
Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
Left APD
Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.  Was not in UMN fashion.
Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.


Assessment:  
Status post TIA possibly related to AF

Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.  The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.


Plan:
Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
Continue 
ASA and coumadin and statin
Continued HTN and DM control
Will touch base with ophthalmology regarding the left optic neuropathy

Return in 6 months.

RE: EGAN, VAL
MRN: 8268084
DOB: 07/30/2063


Dear Dr. Rucker, 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Val in the office today. As you recall, he is a very pleasant 71-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years. He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain. He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain. Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable. He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma. 


MEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine, Lyrica, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin. 


ALLERGIES: None. 


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy. 


SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a laboratory technician and lives in cincinnati.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain. His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal. 


IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia. The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging. I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression. He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression. I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered. A surgical consent was obtained. The plan is to perform the surgery on 08/31/2135. Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy. 


I thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

MRN: [MEDICALRECORD]
DOB: [DATE]


Dear Dr. [DOCTOR], 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. [PATIENT] in the office today. As you recall, he is a very pleasant [AGE]-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years. He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain. He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain. Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable. He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma. 


MEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine, Lyrica, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin. 


ALLERGIES: None. 


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy. 


SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a [PROFESSION] and lives in [CITY].


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain. His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal. 


IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia. The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging. I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression. He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression. I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered. A surgical consent was obtained. The plan is to perform the surgery on [DATE]. Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy. 


I thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

History of Presenting Illness
Mr. Egan is a 72 year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and Type II DM. Two weeks ago, he noted intermittent episodes of exertional dyspnea. He was started on albuterol and advair with no improvement. On 08/30/2135, he experienced worsening exertional shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. He sought medical attention at Natchaug Hospital ED. An initial ECG revealed Q waves in V1-V4. He ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin on 2.0. He was found to be in congestive heart failure. He was given plavix, aspirin, lovenox and IV lasix with improvement in symptoms. 
On 08/31/2135, he was transferred to Gibson Community Hospital for cardiac catheterization. The results were significant for multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%. He was referred to Dr. Sebastian Dang for elective cardiac surgical revascularization and possible mitral valve repair. He was discharged to home on 09/02/2135. 
On 09/03/2135, he developed recurrent left sided chest pressure while at rest. He took 2 SL TNG with improvement in symptoms. He presented to Gibson Community Hospital ED. He was started on IV heparin. Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative. He was found to have an elevated BNP to 2817. A CXR showed congestive heart failure. He was admitted to CAU. He had an episode of chest pressure while at rest that resolved with 1 SL TNG. He is being referred for consideration of cardiac surgery.

	Reason for visit:
   72 y.o. admit s/p cardiac catherization revealing patent LAD stent


	Interval History:
   72 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, and CAD. He sufferred a NSTEMI on 8/30/35. A cath at that time revealed an occluded mid LAD lesion, a 75% ostial OM2 stenosis, a 90% OM4 stenosis, and a non-dominant RCA with a 90% stenosis. His LVEF was estimated at 25-30% with moderate MR. He was discharged home on 9/02/35 to orbit for future CABG. 
9/03/35 He was admitted to Natchaug Hospital secondary to recurrent rest pain. n 9/04/35 Echo revealing moderate MR with no other significant valvular abnormalities. There was segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septal, apical, inferior, and anterior territories. EF 55%.  There was segmental right ventricular dysfunction involving the apex. The plan was for this patient to undergo CABG; however the patients wife was involved in a serious MVA, and with further discussion the decision was made to take him to the cath lab to attempt PCI so that the patient could be with his wife as soon as possible. 
9/05/35 He was taken to the CCL. mid LAD had a 100% occlusion after the D1. The D1 was a small vessel with an ostial, eccentric, 90% lesion. The OM2 had a 60% eccentric lesion that did not appear flow limiting. The LPDA had a 95% complex lesion in the proximal third. He underwent stenting of the native mid LAD with a  Xience OTW 2.5 X 23mm stent with an excellent result. This was followed by kissing-balloon angioplasty of the ostium of the 1st diagonal and the LAD. The pre-intervention stenosis was 90% with 0% residual stenosis. Finally, stenting of the proximal third of the left PDA was performed using a Xience V 2.5 x 15mm and a 2.5 x 12mm stent. The pre-intervention stenosis was 95% with 0% residual stenosis. At the end of the case, there was TIMI III flow throughout with no perforation or dissection. The patient remained stable throughout the rest of the admission with no further chest discomfort. He was discharged home on 9/06/35. 

Since his discharge he has noticed that he was dyspneic with lying flat. He has also noticed some exertional fatigue and dyspnea. He presented to Natchaug Hospital for further evaluation.  His ECG showed no acute changes, CXR consistent with mild CHF.  He has been aggressively diuresed with improvement  in his level of dyspnea. He was transferred to GCH for a repeat cardiac catheterization. 
Cath today revealing:  Widely patent LAD and LPDA stents. Balloon angioplasty site of proximal D1 patent. Nondominant RCA with 90% proximal lesion Severe cardiomyopathy with mid-distal anterior, apical, and mid-distal inferior hypokinesis. EF 25% with LVEDP 20. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

              was complete.  Retrieval was complete.

              Hemorrhoids with no bleeding were found.

              A few diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon and in the

              hepatic flexure.

Impression:   1) Single polyp - three mm.  Complete removal was accomplished.

              3) Hemorrhoids.

              4) Diverticulosis.

         DYSTROPHIC GOBLET CELLS IN CRYPTS, AND RARE METAPLASTIC PANETH

         CELLS.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

76 year old female with three days of painless BRBPR, also reports of black stool, history of PUD.  Source of bleeding not clear.  Pattern most typical of LGIB, likely diverticular with significant decline in hematocrit, painless, moderate volume BRBPR.  Agree no real pain for ischemic colitis, though wbc elevated.  No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.  Given black stools, aspirin use, history of PUD, upper bleed also possible, though presentation with red blood and hemodynamic stability atypical for this.  Given insecurity in type of bleed, agree with both EGD and colonoscopy.  



EGD and colonoscopy this morning

Hold aspirin

Continue QD PPI

If hematocrit drops further, would transfuse 1-2 units to hct of 28-30

Dear Dr.  Morgan:



  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.  She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago. She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD. She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine. She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler. With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.  She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time. These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week. She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes. 



To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus. This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery. There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery. She was then referred to me for further evaluation.



			Past medical history:

   Hypertension. 

Hyperlipidemia. 

Glucose intolerance. 

Left bundle branch block. 

Diverticular bleed. 

Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 

Hypothyroidism. 

COPD.



Current Medications:

 prednisone taper

hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg qd

potassium chloride 10 mEq qd

lisinopril 30 mg qd

aspirin 81 mg qd

calcium supplement 600 mg qd

levothyroxine 25 mcg qd

Lipitor 10 mg qd

Celexa 40 mg qd

albuterol inhaler; Dir: and nebulizer

multivitamins



Allergies:

			

Allergy   She reports receiving Halothane gas remotely with the development of jaundice at the time of her hysterectomy.

Drug allergy   Halothane gas, which caused hepatitis per her report.



			Family history:

   Notable for her father with myocardial infarction at 54.  Mother with ""an enlarged heart,"" who died at 82.



			Social history:

   She quit smoking eight years ago, previously smoked two packs per day for 35 years.  She lives alone but her daughter lives above her in the same building.



			Review of systems:

   She denies any significant change in weight.  She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil.  She reports chronic cough and wheeze, which has been improved on prednisone.  She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain.  No lower extremity edema, palpitations, or dizzy spells.  She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium.  She has no history of stroke, no history of anemia.  She reports her sugars have been diet controlled.  Otherwise extended review of systems was negative.



Physical examination:

			

-Pulse:   70

-BP: 142/70  

-General:   She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest

-Skin:   Free of rashes

-Heent:   benign

-Neck:   JVP was at 5.  She had 2+ carotids without bruits

-Chest:   Lungs are clear without significant wheeze

-Cardiac:   Regular, S1 and S2 without murmurs

-Abdomen:   Soft with a nontender reducible ventral hernia

-Extremities:   She had no edema in her extremities with 2+ distal pulses

-Neuro:   She is alert and oriented

-weight:   185 pounds



			EKG:

    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.



			Assessment and plan:

   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past. She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy. Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm. I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan. She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.



Plan: 

1. Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment. 

2. Treatment of her emphysema as per your office. 

3. I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation. 

4. I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.

Pulmonary Consult by Dr. Trujillo for management of PE

I have seen and examined the patient and agree with the history including HPI, PMHx, Meds, All, Family Hx, ROS; Pexam, labs, studies, assessment and plan as per Dr. Chavez.

Briefly, 78 YO female with recent hip fracture in 8/01 (not surgically repaired) who did well until 3 days PTA when she developed sudden onset CP, non-productive cough and was noted to have RA sat of 89%.  In ED, patient was hemodynamically stable.  CTPE protocol bilateral PE   s in both main PA   s and clot in LLE DV system.  Patient was started on UF heparin.  

PMHx notable for NSTEMI, diffuse CAD, left pleural mass followed by Fidious, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, took coumadin after surgery 30 years ago 

Meds include:  Advair, Lipitor, HCTZ, heparin

Smoked 50 pk-years, quit 8 years ago.

Family hx notable for:  Son passed away in    01 with blood clots.

Pexam:
Sats 94% on 4L, T 98, P 78, BP 186/86 R 20
Gen Comfortable.
O/P Clear
Heart RRR no m/g/r
Lungs decreased BS throughout
Ext:  Superficial varicosities, minimal bilateral edema

Labs notable for:  WBC 15
Trop 0.22
Ntbnp 500

CT scan     multiple large central PE   s and bilateral upper and lower arteries; +emphysema; clot in left popliteal and distal and superficial femoral veins.

ECHO     EF 60%, mod TR RA dilation, RVSP>=54; RV hypokinetic, PFO with R   shunting   (increased RVSP, RA size since last ECHO)

Impression:

Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality
Persistent DVT
PFO with right to left shunt
COPD

Recs:

Recommend retrievable IVC filter.  Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
Hypercoag w/u
Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD



Thanks for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient,

Lungs decreased BS throughout
Ext:  Superficial varicosities, minimal bilateral edema

Labs notable for:  WBC 15
Trop 0.22
Ntbnp 500

CT scan     multiple large central PE   s and bilateral upper and lower arteries; +emphysema; clot in left popliteal and distal and superficial femoral veins.

ECHO     EF 60%, mod TR RA dilation, RVSP>=54; RV hypokinetic, PFO with R   shunting   (increased RVSP, RA size since last ECHO)

Impression:

Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality
Persistent DVT
PFO with right to left shunt
COPD

Recs:

Recommend retrievable IVC filter.  Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
Hypercoag w/u
Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD



Thanks for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient,

This is my first visit with Teresa Hardy (MR#36052413), a 54 yo F here to
meet her new PCP. She has not seen a doctor in many years.  She made this appt,
because she had heavy vaginal bleeding 2 weeks ago.  She normally has her
periods q28d, with 5 days of heavy flow.  Her last period lasted for 15 days
with the usual clots and heavy flow.  The bleeding stopped 2 weeks ago, and
there is no spotting now.  She denies any abd pain.  She denies possiblity of
pregnancy, although she has unprotected intercourse with a longtime partner.
 
PMH:  staph aureus UTI 2066
      h/o multiple UTI's
      last PAP in 5/64 - squamous metaplasia

Neuro:  nonfocal
 
Impression:  54 yo perimenopausal woman.
Plan:
1.  GYN - prolonged menstrual cycle likely from perimenopausal state.  Since
this was her first episode of prolonged bleeding, will not pursue further w/u
at this point.  Pt given reassurance, and asked to continue to record the dates
and duration of her menses.  Pt denied h/o fibroids or FHx of GYN cancer. 
 
2.  CV - pt reports h/o BP's of 160/80 in the past.  She was 162/100 today.
She was very reluctant to initiate any BP medicine (I suggested atenolol 25 mg
po QAM), and want to try diet and exercise first.  She understands the health
risks of HTN and knows that it is very common among African Americans.  Will
follow this issue closely and readdress at next visit.
 
3.  Health maintenance - await PAP results.  Will check CBC, SMA7 and lipid
panel today.  Will schedule screening mammogram at next visit.

Preceptor EVANS,NELSON MAC,M.D. Note:
Seen with Dr. Thorpe and discussed.  Is perimenopausal, had 15-day period once. 
No pap since 2064.  BP was 162/100.  Dr. Thorpe did a pap, will follow periods. 
SUspect she is hypertensive, but she is reluctant to take meds.  Discussed
risks of htn with her.  She will FU with Dr. Thorpe.

HARDY,TERESA   360-52-41-3                    VISIT DATE: 12/03/75

This patient was seen concurrently with Dr. Jeter, whose note I 

have reviewed and with which I agree. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 56-year-old female who 

presents with complaints of chest pain.  The patient has a known 

history of coronary artery disease and most recently had a stent 

placed in April of 2075.  The patient had an episode of chest 

tightness with dyspnea while walking to catch a bus.  The patient 

states that this is unusual for her.  She does not usually have 

discomfort with exertion since having her stent placed.  That did 

resolve with rest and now the patient states she had a just ""trace"" 

of chest tightness throughout the day otherwise.  The patient came 

to Abbeville General Hospital and while walking uphill towards 

the hospital entrance she had recurrence of her discomfort.  The 

patient is pain-free on arrival to the emergency department.   

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 

angioplasty, stent, coronary artery disease, pulmonary 

hypertension. 

MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide, aspirin, Lasix, and otherwise as per the 

written note.

ALLERGIES:  Actifed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

female in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.9, pulse 

87, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 161/93.  Oxygen saturation 

is 98% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 

equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular 

motions are intact.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No 

crackles.  No wheezes.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  

Physical exam is otherwise as per the written note.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION: Labs are significant for an EKG which shows 

a sinus rhythm at 87 beats per minute.  There are 1-mm ST 

depressions in leads V5 and V6.  This was compared to a prior EKG 

from July 2075 and was found to be without significant change.  The 

only new change on the EKG is that a previously biphasic T-wave in 

V4 is now upright.  Glucose is 215, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1, sodium 

140, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, bicarb 32, CK 321, MB 3.1, trauma 

0.07, calcium 9.4, white count 8.8, hematocrit 40.1, platelets 247, 

PT 11.3, PTT 25.0.  Urinalysis shows no blood, no leukocyte 

esterase, no nitrates.  Chest x-ray shows no infiltrate, no 

pulmonary edema.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated 

in the emergency department with labs and studies obtained as 

documented above.  The patient's history is concerning for angina.  

The patient received an aspirin, as well as Lopressor, while in the 

emergency department.  She has remained pain-free throughout her 

period of observation while in the emergency department.  The 

patient will require serial cardiac enzymes due to her most recent 

chest discomfort being en route to the hospital and if these are 

unremarkable the patient will require a functional cardiac study 

such as an exercise tolerance test. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Angina.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

Re:  Umstead, Kenneth
     MR #401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology office today
and he seems to be doing very well from a cardiovascular
perspective.  Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has
undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps. 
Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.  This has been
reevaluated and he has been stable.  The fourth polyp will need to
be removed at a later time.  At this point, his aspirin has been
discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also
discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests. 
His current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day,
Metoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd.  He is aware of a
belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no
exertional or other related symptoms.  He is reasonably active but
somewhat limited by his claudication.
 
On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130/70,
a heart rate of 65 and regular.  Head and neck were unremarkable. 
Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension
at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a
physiologic split.  There is an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was
unremarkable.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  
 
His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus
rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left
intraventricular conduction delay.

I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well.  It would be of
value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since
2069.  He had minimal ischemia at that time.  There are no symptoms
that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will
see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings. 
 
 
If any problems develop, please don't hesitate to contact me. 
Thank you very much for allowing me to help with his care.
 
Kindest personal regards.

Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology Office today
and he seems like he is improved. He feels his legs are better and
that he can walk greater distances. He feels very comfortable. 
 
His current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day,
Nifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day. 
 
On exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146/76, a heart rate of
65 and regular. Weight 210 pounds. Head and neck unremarkable.
Chest is clear. Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur. The rest of his exam was unremarkable.
 
Resting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal
sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation. There is a nonspecific
intraventricular conduction delay. 
 
I think Mr. Umstead is doing very well. He would like to have his
arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that
schedule. In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and
if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and
more prolonged risk prevention. I suggest that we increase it to 50
mg bid. I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an
eye on it. If it drops too low we can reduce the dose. He asked
that I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation
and I will be happy to do so. If any problems develop in the
interim please do not hesitate to contact me. 
 
Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.

Re:  Kenneth Umstead
     MR#  401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology Office today and
he feels he has actually improved.  His primary limitation had been
his claudication, but he feels that he can walk better now than in
the past.  We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure
and volumes, and these actually were unchanged from a prior study
two years ago.  The post volume recordings were normal in each leg. 
Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg
consistent with mild anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis disease.  No
systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg.  These were
unchanged from January, 2072.  Mr. Umstead feels that he can be more
physically active and is less limited.
 
His current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.,
Nifedipine XL 60 mg q.d., and Lasix 20 mg q.d.
 
Of note, in October, 2073, he was found by colonoscopy to have four
polyps which were removed.  Apparently, no malignant cells were
seen in the pathologic specimens.
 
On exam, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 122/68, heart
rate 63 and regular, weight 205 lbs.  HEENT unremarkable.  Chest
was clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 30
degrees, PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 normal but physiologically
split.  There was an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
lower left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable. 
Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
 
His resting 12 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, left axis
deviation, and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent
with his left anterior hemiblock.
 
I think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well.  He asked that I see him
again in six months for routine re-evaluation, and I would be happy
to do so. If any problems develop in the interim please don't
hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to participate

Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Umstead, Kenneth
MRN:  9544546
ADMIT DATE: 7/02/84 
ATTENDING: Vernon Toth
PCP:  Vernon Toth
CONTACT:  Valeria Umstead (056) 216-7457

CC:  lethargy, increasing disorientation x2 weeks

HPI:  
Mr Umstead is an 87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathy (s/p CEA, known PVD) who presents after two weeks of increased lethargy, increasing disorientation and visual hallucinations.

Per his wife who acts as his primary caretaker, Mr Umstead was in his USOH until about two weeks ago, when she began noticing increased lethargy and confusion.  He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other, and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own.  This increased in severity over the past 3-4 days.  He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits. He has had no recent fevers, chills, SOB, sudden motor or sensory loss.   No new incontinence.

This history was limited by patient   s inability to cooperate.

ED COURSE:  Tox screen and metabolic workup in ED were both negative. CXR and U/A performed showing no infectious processes.  Head CT was performed showing no change from prior, though there was a small increase in the size of the lateral ventricles possibly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus.  LP was negative.  Pt was admitted to Internal Medicine for further workup of recent change in mental status and neuro/psych consult.

MEDICAL HISTORY
Cerebellar stroke: 1/82.  Coumadin d/c'd 8/82, Aggrenox started. Felt better risk/benefit profile

Diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy 
Urethral stricture: Sees Dr Valle
Dementia: Followed by Dr Umali. Felt mixed vascular and AD dementia. On ACH inhibitor. Started Namenda 11/82.
Bundle branch block: EKG 7/82 NSR with first degree a-v block and LBBB with LAD. EKG 10/83 normal sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block and occasional blocked APC. There is a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay with a borderline superior axis. There are nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.
Renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.6-2.2
Depression 
Vitamin D deficiency
		
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION 
Atenolol 25MG PO QD

Lipitor 20 MG PO QD 
Namenda (MEMANTINE) 10 MG PO BID 
Fish OIL CAPSULE (OMEGA-3-FATTY ACIDS) 1000 MG PO BID 

ALLERGIES:  Ace Inhibitors - Cough, escitalopram - GI Intolerance 

FAMILY HISTORY: Significant family history for DM.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with wife who is primary caretaker. Nonsmoker, no EtOH per report.

PHYSICAL EXAM
VS: T=97.2, HR=80, BP=174/76, RR=20, 94% on RA
Gen: WAWN, NAD, lying in bed speaking in complete sentences, tangential thoughts
HEENT: NC/AT.  PERRLA, arcus senilis. EOMI, no nystagmus. Nl oropharynx, MMM. 
CV: RRR, no m/r/g

LABS
Na 144, K 4.1, Cl 106, CO2 27.4, Ca 9.4, PO4 2.0, Mg 1.7, BUN 23, Cr 1.7, Gluc 124
Tox panel negative
CSF sugar 79, TP 59, colorless, clear, no xanthochromia, 1RBC, no WBC, otherwise neg.
WBC 7.1, HCT 39.9, Plt 192, RDW 14.4, MCV 89
U/A negative

RADIOLOGY
MRI Brain (7/02/84)
No acute infarction.
Chronic right basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellar infarctions, stable from prior.
Mild progression of periventricular and deep white matter T2  hyperintensity which is nonspecific, likely relating to progression of small vessel ischemic disease.
Interval enlargement of ventricles and sulci consistent with progression of cortical volume loss.

CXR (7/02/84):  WNL

CT Brain (7/02/84)
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Mildly increased prominence of the lateral ventricles with increased periventricular hypoattenuation.  Although this likely represents microangiopathic changes with commensurate ventricular prominence, consider normal pressure hydrocephalus in the correct clinical setting.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm, 1st degree AV block with atrial bigemeny. Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL >11.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.  The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.  Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.  Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.  However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.  Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.  As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely. LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.  One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.

A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.  Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly. However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.

Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative. CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.  Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
will d/w attending
consider psychiatric consult
Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH

H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.

NIDDM: Will start RISS

Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD

HTN: metoprolol

Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.

Code Status: Will need to discuss with wife tomorrow.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with wife who is primary caretaker. Nonsmoker, no EtOH per report.

PHYSICAL EXAM
VS: T=97.2, HR=80, BP=174/76, RR=20, 94% on RA
Gen: WAWN, NAD, lying in bed speaking in complete sentences, tangential thoughts
HEENT: NC/AT.  PERRLA, arcus senilis. EOMI, no nystagmus. Nl oropharynx, MMM. 
CV: RRR, no m/r/g

RADIOLOGY
MRI Brain ([DATE])
No acute infarction.
Chronic right basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellar infarctions, stable from prior.
Mild progression of periventricular and deep white matter T2  hyperintensity which is nonspecific, likely relating to progression of small vessel ischemic disease.
Interval enlargement of ventricles and sulci consistent with progression of cortical volume loss.

CXR ([DATE]):  WNL

CT Brain ([DATE])
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Mildly increased prominence of the lateral ventricles with increased periventricular hypoattenuation.  Although this likely represents microangiopathic changes with commensurate ventricular prominence, consider normal pressure hydrocephalus in the correct clinical setting.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm, 1st degree AV block with atrial bigemeny. Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL >11.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
[AGE]yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.  The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.  Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.  Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.  However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.  Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.  As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely. LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.  One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.

A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.  Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly. However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr [PATIENT] is currently difficult to direct with questioning.

Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative. CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.  Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
will d/w attending
consider psychiatric consult
Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH

H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.

NIDDM: Will start RISS

Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD

HTN: metoprolol

Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.

Code Status: Will need to discuss with wife tomorrow.

MRN: 80531359 
DOV: 05/28/90 


Mr. Ocampo comes in for follow up of his hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia and also wants to assess his impotence.  Mr. 
Ocampo gets only semi-erections.  He was quite depressed about this 
issue during March, but he feels that his mood has improved.  His 
daughter, Urbina, did talk to me in the hallway about concerns that her 
father might be depressed although he feels that this was a significant 
component of the issue.  He had not had chest pain, chest pressure or 
fainting spells.  He has had no nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or 
constipation.  Urinary symptoms are stable.  His neurological status is 
fine. He tried to lose 5 pounds by exercising and was successful.

EXAM:  On physical examination today his blood pressure is 130/74.  His 
HEENT exam is unremarkable.  His chest is clear.  His heart shows no 
murmurs.  His abdominal examination is benign.  His rectal is guaiac 
negative with a smooth prostate.  I gave him a pack of stool guaiac 
cards.  

ASSESSMENT:  I will give him a prescription of Viagra and I gave him 
appropriate patient education.  I will see him in six months.  I will 
get some laboratory tests and write him a letter.  We will be tuned 
into the issue of depression going forward.

Kenneth X. Sylvester, Jr., M.D.
Holden District Hospital

Dear Ken:

Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.

The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.

On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.

Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Wil,



INTERVAL HISTORY:

Mrs. Ulibarri returned today for follow-up of coronary artery disease, post recent CABG.  As you know, her course was complicated by heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and she has been continued on Coumadin anticoagulation.  She has done relatively well in five weeks since surgery and her energy level has improved.  The major ongoing symptoms is aching in the upper part of the sternum, and an opening in the lower part of the incision which drains some purulent material.  She also has a suture and her leg which has worked its way to the surface and causes some discomfort.  Her breathing is much better than preoperatively, and she has had no chest pain.  She has very mild residual dyspnea.  She has had mild edema at times, but it has largely resolved.  She has had no fever.



Review of Systems:                                                                                                  .

All of the following are normal or negative.  GENERAL:  night sweats, fever and chills.  HEAD AND NECK: headaches, hoarseness.  RESPIRATORY: cough, coughing up blood.  CARDIOVASCULAR: see history above.  GASTROINTESTINAL: frequent heartburn or indigestion, difficulty swallowing, black or tarry stools, nausea/vomiting.  URINARY: frequent urination at night, urinary tract infections, blood in urine.  NEUROLOGIC: transient paralysis, seizures, visual loss in one eye.  HEMATOLOGIC: easy bruising.  SKIN: new rashes or eruptions, poor healing of foot sores, moles that are changing size.  ENDOCRINE: elevated blood sugars, thyroid problems.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: low back pain, joint pains, joint swelling.



Family and Social History:

Family and social history have not changed.  There is no pertinent new information which has bearing on the current problems.



Physical Examination: .

She looks quite well.  Her blood pressure is 160/80.  Central venous pressure is normal and lungs are clear.  There is mild tenderness with no redness or swelling over the upper end of the sternum, and there is a 1 cm in diameter opening of the incision at the lower end, with sero-purulent drainage.  Lungs are clear.  Heart shows regular rhythm and I hear no rub or murmur.  Liver is not palpable and there is no edema.  There was a small end of a suture from the small leg incision, which I clipped off.



Electrocardiogram: .

Normal sinus rhythm.  Anterior T-wave inversion, somewhat to tracing.  Before the operation.



Overall, Mrs. Ulibarri is improved.  I asked him concerns about possible smoldering infection of her sternum.  I will send her to Trevino made to for the surgical team to violate this, and will then a CT scan of her chest and sternum looking for any collection of pus.



I have encouraged her to continue to be active.  Her walking is limited by pain, which limits or exercise.  She has already returned to her part-time work.



I made no change in her regimen today.  Our plan to see her again a couple of months and she will continue on Coumadin anticoagulation.  I'll keep you posted.



							Sincerely yours,







							William C. Sargent, M.D.

534 Lunar Lane                           61248040
Brookshire, MO  15345                             4-12-84
 
 
Referring Physician:  Dr. Kenyon, Dr. Elmer Ure, Vallejo General 
Cardiology.  
 
Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant. Rule out 
osteoporosis.  
 
HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.  At 
the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.  
Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
approximately 26 weeks.  At that point, he was believed to be in 
remission and stayed in remission since then.  
 
In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.  Subsequently he 
was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.  
He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.  The patient's 
complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.  There is 
no peripheral neuropathy.  There is no autonomic neuropathy.  No retinal 
disease.  However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
creatinine currently of 2.4.  
 
Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
symptoms in the early 80s.  By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
infarctions.  In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.  Since 
that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
degree of symptoms.  
 
The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.  Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.  
 
Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
was from a trauma some years ago.  Other past medical history includes 
history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.

Family History:  His sister, aged 54, and mother, have osteoporosis with 
his mother having fairly severe osteoporosis with a normal of vertebral 
collapses and some nerve damage.  His father and mother have had 
diabetes mellitus, his father dying of heart disease.  There is a 
19-year-old daughter who has a history of migraines.  There is no 
history of thyroid disease in the family.
 
Social History:  He currently works at Belkin and has a desk job 
there.  He quit smoking and drinking 15-20 years ago.  He has been 
married for over 20 years.  His review of symptoms revealed the absence 
of GI symptoms.  There were no orthostatic symptoms, no angina.  Normal 
sexual function.  He denied any skin problems or rashes.  He denied 
numbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  There is a history of 
hypertension.  
 
Other review of systems:  His height has been stable at 6'2"" tall.  
 
Physical Examination:  Blood pressure 130/93.  Heart rate 96.   The 
patient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  His height is 
6'2"".  Weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  He 
has a mild Cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical 
and supraclavicular fat.  Retina appeared without lesions.  Normal 
extra-ocular movements.  His oral mucosa was moist without evidence of 
thrush.  Neck exam:  He had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  
Normal thyroid.   His chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal 
excretion.  There was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  
His cardiac exam:  He had a soft, S1, S2.  Cardiac exam otherwise 
unremarkable.  His abdomen was soft.  He had some evidence of insulin 
injections, but no significant hypertrophy.  He injects both in his 
abdomen and rotates with his arms.  His extremities revealed minimal 
stasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  No edema.  
Neurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  He had normal to slightly 
decreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.  
 
Laboratory Exam:  Most recent laboratories that I could find were 
February 09, 2084.  Sodium 141.  K 5.1; chloride 105.  Bicarb 20.  BUN 
39.  Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  His CK was 219.  Calcium 9.7.  
Albumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  Alkaline phosphatase was 90.  Uric acid 
5.1; magnesium 1.9.  TSH was 1.6.  Cholesterol 242.  Triglycerides 226.  
His cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  His CBC 
revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a 
normal differential.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of 
multiple medical problems.  The one's most pertinent to us currently are

the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
osteoporosis.  The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  
The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
patients.  However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
this makes sense.  We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
reasons.  We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  We would be a little 
reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
without more information about this patient.  The patient's diabetes 
seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.  Given the fact that it sounds like 
he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
situation.  Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

numbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  There is a history of 
hypertension.  
 
Other review of systems:  His height has been stable at 6'2"" tall.  
 
Physical Examination:  Blood pressure 130/93.  Heart rate 96.   The 
patient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  His height is 
6'2"".  Weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  He 
has a mild Cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical 
and supraclavicular fat.  Retina appeared without lesions.  Normal 
extra-ocular movements.  His oral mucosa was moist without evidence of 
thrush.  Neck exam:  He had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  
Normal thyroid.   His chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal 
excretion.  There was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  
His cardiac exam:  He had a soft, S1, S2.  Cardiac exam otherwise 
unremarkable.  His abdomen was soft.  He had some evidence of insulin 
injections, but no significant hypertrophy.  He injects both in his 
abdomen and rotates with his arms.  His extremities revealed minimal 
stasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  No edema.  
Neurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  He had normal to slightly 
decreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.  
 
Laboratory Exam:  Most recent laboratories that I could find were 
[DATE].  Sodium 141.  K 5.1; chloride 105.  Bicarb 20.  BUN 
39.  Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  His CK was 219.  Calcium 9.7.  
Albumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  Alkaline phosphatase was 90.  Uric acid 
5.1; magnesium 1.9.  TSH was 1.6.  Cholesterol 242.  Triglycerides 226.  
His cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  His CBC 
revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a 
normal differential.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  This is a [AGE]-year-old gentleman with a history of 
multiple medical problems.  The one's most pertinent to us currently are

the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
osteoporosis.  The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  
The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
patients.  However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
this makes sense.  We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
reasons.  We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  We would be a little 
reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
without more information about this patient.  The patient's diabetes 
seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.  Given the fact that it sounds like 
he has got pretty good care by Dr. [DOCTOR], we will not pursue this at 
the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
situation.  Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

RE:  Edwin Workman
     MR #612-48-04-0
 
Dear Dr. Paz:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. 
Overall, he is doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective. 
Unfortunately, he continues to gain weight but overall he is doing
well. 
 
His current medical regimen includes cyclosporin 150 b.i.d.,
prednisone 6 mg q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 mg q.d.,
Cardura 4 mg q.d., one baby aspirin a day, Axid 150 b.i.d.,
pravachol 20 q.d., magnesium oxide 250 mg b.i.d., calcium and
vitamin D, insulin NPH 54 units and 10 Regular in the morning, 32
units of NPH and 8 of Regular in the evening.  
 
On physical examination, he was obese.  Blood pressure of 150/90
with a heart rate of 85, weight was 305 pounds which is increased
5 pounds from September 21st.  Chest was clear to auscultation and
percussion.  Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non-
displaced PMI with a normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His abdomen
is obese, soft and nontender.  It is difficult to appreciate any
organomegaly.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  Extremities are
without edema. 
 
Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 85. 
Intervals of .16/.08/.34 with an axis of 60 degrees.  This is a
normal tracing unchanged from previous tracing.
 
Therefore, Mr. Workman is doing well from a cardiovascular
perspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
regimen according to his laboratory results.  Unfortunately, he did
take his cyclosporin this morning and therefore he will mail his
labs back to us.
 
I did discuss with him attempting some weight loss with portion
control.  I think it might work to give him some reasonable goals
such as a weight loss of 30 pounds as apposed to 130.

Dear Dr. Paz:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. 
Overall he is relatively stable from a cardiac standpoint.  Most
importantly, recently he was laid off from his job at Belkin.  He
has been quite depressed about this.

Mag. Oxide 250 q.d., Paxil 300 q.d., NPH Insulin.
 
On physical examination he was well appearing in no distress.  He
had a blood pressure of 136/80 with a heart rate of 90, weight was
309 pounds which has increased eight pounds from July.  Chest was
clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP at 30

RE:Fair, Bill

MR#:220-41-86-4

 

Dear Dr. Keys:

 

Dr. Oates and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome 

right knee.  As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.  He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, 

mainly related to sports injuries.

 

He has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.  It got so 

bad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that. 

 

It has slowly got better since then.  

 

At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with 

activity but he also has rest and night pain.  He has a restricted walking 

distance.

 

With regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and 

requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.  He has 

noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.  

 

With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of 

Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to 

have a colonoscopy in the near future.  

 

He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.

 

On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than 

the left.  He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.  

 

He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of 

arthritis.  He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 

degrees.  His varus deformity is not fully correctable.  He has grade 5 

quadriceps power.  

 

X-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete 

obliteration of joint space on the right side.  

 

I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment 

arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.  

 

We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial 

osteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement. 

 

At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe 

enough to warrant operative intervention.  We would certainly reconsider 

should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, 

instilling some corticosteroids.  We have advised him that this will only 

provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin 

some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.

 

We have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will 

reassess him.  Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly 

ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the 

knee and instill some corticosteroid.  

 

With kind regards.  

 

Yours sincerely,

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  Elizabeth Keys, M.D.



CHIEF COMPLAINT:  diabetes management.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old patient with a history of diabetes diagnosed more than 20 years ago.  He has known complication of retinopathy and is status post bilateral laser surgery about one year ago.  He has no known neuropathy or nephropathy.  He has no known history of CAD, CVA or PVD.  He had previously been followed by Dr. Elizabeth Keys at Pioneer Hospital at Findlay until June of this year which time he switched to a new primary care doctor.  At that time, he had been on glyburide, metformin and Avandia, his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia.  He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient. Over the next weeks to months, the patient had progressive peripheral edema, fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 60 mg orally on this.  He self adjusted his Avandia dose from 4 mg twice daily to 2 mg daily.  His prebreakfast blood glucose has been elevated ranging from 160-200.  He has had some resolution of his fluid overload with the Lasix and lower dose Avandia.  He says he has persistent feeling of swelling and tightness in his fingers and toes with episodic ankle swelling as well.  He denies chest pain, claudication polyuria, polydipsia.  He has been losing weight since starting Lasix.  He has never had hypoglycemia.



DIABETES SURVELLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT:

Hemoglobin A1c 11.4% (10/01/84).

Cholesterol 190, LDL cholesterol 190, HDL 49 (10/01/84) and LDL 118 (07/02/84).

Microalbumin to creatinine 19 (07/02/84).

Creatinine 0.9 (07/02/84).

Last eye exam 09/83.

Pneumovax never.

Influenza vaccine never.

Aspirin 325 mg daily.

ACE inhibitor yes (lisinopril 10 mg daily,).

Statin yes (Lipitor 40 mg daily).



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Diabetes as above.

Diabetic retinopathy.

Hypertension.

Osteoarthritis of the knees.

Status post hammertoe repair.

Pilonidal cyst status post I&D.

Severed Achilles tendon status post repair.

Right meniscus removal.



MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg twice daily, metformin 1000 mg twice daily and the Avandia 2 mg daily, Lipitor 40 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily.  furosemide 60 mg daily, multivitamin one tablet daily and Viagra as needed.



ALLERGIES:  Amoxicillin gives him a rash.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a manager in a convenience store, he lives with his wife.  He has no kids.  He does not exercise secondary to joint pain.  He tends to eat a lot of carbohydrates and meats although he does not have a sweet tooth.  He denies tobacco, alcohol or recreational drug use.  



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, otherwise, negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His weight is 270 pounds, his blood pressure is 150/92 and then 155/92 to my a repeat exam, pulse is 70 and regular.  In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman in no acute distress.  His skin is warm and dry.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.  He has no carotid bruits.  His thyroid is normal in size and contour.  Lung exam reveals crackles at the bases.  His heart is regular in rate and rhythm with an S1, S2, without S3 or S4.  Abdomen is obese, soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities are without clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 2+ pitting edema to the ankles.  His foot exam reveals that his distal pulses are okay.  Sensation is intact to monofilament.  There is no skin breakdown or ulcerations.  He has an extensive onychomycosis of the nails bilaterally.



Glucose 132.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman with type II diabetes complicated by retinopathy and erectile dysfunction.  He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia.  He has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control, should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation, especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia.



1.  We will start insulin today initially NPH 25 units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide.  We have instructed him on use of the Inolet for insulin administration.  He will continue his glyburide 10 mg each morning, continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and Avandia 2 mg each morning.  We will check hemoglobin A1c today as a baseline. We will follow up to determine appropriate titration of his insulin as well as addition of other doses during the day.

2.  His blood pressure is not optimally controlled at this time.  We will increase his lisinopril to 40 mg daily. He will continue his furosemide 60 mg daily and he will continue to titrate his Lasix dosing at the guidance of his primary care doctor.

3.  His last microalbumin to creatinine ratio and creatinine were normal.  Testing is up-to-date.

4.  The patient has an LDL that was above target this summer and Lipitor was initiated; however, he has not been on this long enough to see an effect. At his next visit, we will reevaluate his lipids to determine if his Lipitor needs titration.

5.  He is overdue for an eye exam and will contact Dr. Xuereb at Findlay him to have this done.

6.  We have made a referral to Dr. Liam Mcmahon for cardiology evaluation.  We have ordered an echocardiogram to be performed prior to this visit. We have also referred the patient to a number of possible PCPs in the OMC/CBC system. 



The patient was advised to return to the office in two months for follow up.

Florence Mildred Yuan, M.D.
Endocrinology/Osteopathic Medical Center
02 Weymouth Dr
Plymouth, IN  46368

Dear Dr. Yuan:

I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.  I will be sending a copy of this letter to
Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.

Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.  He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.  About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.  His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.  His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..  He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.

His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.  He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.  He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.  He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.

He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.

His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.  His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.

He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.  Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.  The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.  The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.  The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.

His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.  He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.  Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.  He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.

Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.

His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.

On exam, he is obese but comfortable.  Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  The abdomen is obese.  Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.

His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.  He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.  The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.

Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.  This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.  We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.  In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.  He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.  I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.  We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.

Kindest personal regards.

Dear Dr. Mcmahon:



I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.  He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.  Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.  The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.  The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.  There were no complications.



He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.  His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.  Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.  Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.  He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.  His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.  He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.  Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.  Please call if you have questions.

Family History

Family history is negative for diabetes       



Social History

The patient is currently disabled       .



Habits

The patient is not a smoker.





Review of Systems

ROS: multile joint problems

Feels well in general. No polyuria, dysuria, polydipsia, change in bowel habits or GI distress. Denies symptoms of skin, bladder upper respiratory infections. Energy appropriate, sleep unremarkable, mood stable. No palpitations or dizziness, headaches or visual symptoms.



Meds

Chief Complaint: 

Shortness of breath



History of The Present Illness:  

	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath. He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper. 

He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.  On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.  This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths. He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day. This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.

Radiology

	CXR 9/06/62: IMPRESSION: MILD INCREASE IN LINEAR OPACITIES LIKELY SECONDARY TO INTERSTITIAL EDEMA.



Cardiogram

EKG 9/06/62 04:41- 87 BPM, NSR, non-specific T wave abnormalities consisting of inverted T 

waves in aVL (unchanged from previous EKG 12/30/60), no evidence of ischemic changes



Assessment/Plan:

	In summary, Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of insulin-requiring DM, hypertension, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal. His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.



Problem List and Plan:

SOB/Chest tightness:

	--continue to cycle enzymes for R/O

-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema

	-TTE

	-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV

	-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID 

	-d/c Lisinopril

-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat

	-monitor ins and outs, daily weights

	-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin

Renal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of 

+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment 

-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa

-d/c Lisinopril

-dose Neurontin according to renal function

-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis

-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis

Hypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to 

chronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment

	-continue Toprol XL 100mg QD, Norvasc 5mg BID

-add Hydralazine 10mg QID, Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID

-monitor BP and signs and symptoms of target organ damage closely

Opioid withdrawal/pain management:

	-Morphine PRN

	-consult pain service

DM:

	-sliding scale insulin

	-obtain Insulin and C peptide levels because unclear if currently taking Insulin

Prophylaxis:

	-20mg Nexium PO QD

	-Heparin 5000 units SC BID

Radiology

	CXR [DATE]: IMPRESSION: MILD INCREASE IN LINEAR OPACITIES LIKELY SECONDARY TO INTERSTITIAL EDEMA.



Cardiogram

EKG [DATE] 04:41- 87 BPM, NSR, non-specific T wave abnormalities consisting of inverted T 

waves in aVL (unchanged from previous EKG [DATE]), no evidence of ischemic changes



Assessment/Plan:

	In summary, Mr. [PATIENT] is a [AGE] year old man with a history of insulin-requiring DM, hypertension, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal. His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.



Problem List and Plan:

SOB/Chest tightness:

	--continue to cycle enzymes for R/O

-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema

	-TTE

	-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV

	-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID 

	-d/c Lisinopril

-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat

	-monitor ins and outs, daily weights

	-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin

Renal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of 

+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment 

-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa

-d/c Lisinopril

-dose Neurontin according to renal function

-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis

-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis

Hypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to 

chronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment

	-continue Toprol XL 100mg QD, Norvasc 5mg BID

-add Hydralazine 10mg QID, Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID

-monitor BP and signs and symptoms of target organ damage closely

Opioid withdrawal/pain management:

	-Morphine PRN

	-consult pain service

DM:

	-sliding scale insulin

	-obtain Insulin and C peptide levels because unclear if currently taking Insulin

Prophylaxis:

	-20mg Nexium PO QD

	-Heparin 5000 units SC BID

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

CAPE CORAL HOSPITAL



Personal data and overall health   The patient is a 53-year-old white male, who presents for followup of multiple medical problems.



Major Problems

Diabetes mellitus

Very noncompliant for many years.  Previously had blood sugars as high as 400 to 600 and would not take any medications.  Diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy, which is severe; gastroparesis, which has been severe; recurrent skin abscesses; and probable coronary artery disease.

Hypertension

This has been also severe for many years and noncompliance is a significant issue.  Now complicated also by significant orthostatic hypotension presumably on the basis of autonomic insufficiency.

Coronary artery disease

He is status post recent non Q wave MI with elevated troponins presenting with congestive heart failure and chest pain in the setting of an elevated creatinine.

Chronic renal insufficiency

Creatinine approximately 3.

Pyelonephritis HISTORY OF



Anemia

Chronic.    Extensive workup negative.

Sinus tachycardia

Chronic.  This has been present for many years.  Etiology unclear.  Recent stress test does not show evidence of more complicated arrhythmia.  Cardiac ultrasound was done on his recent admission, and he has an ejection fraction of 63% with no significant valvular disease.  He has symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

Migraine headache HISTORY OF



Hepatitis C

Chronic.



Allergies

No known allergies   



Change in therapies and Renewals

senna 2 teaspoons  BID

aspirin 325 mg  qd

hydralazine 25 mg  TID

Imdur 30 mg  QD

Lasix 20 mg  qd

Nexium 20 mg  qd

Norvasc 5 mg  BID

Neurontin 100 mg  TID

labetalol HCl 100 mg  BID

losartan 25 mg  qd

erythromycin 250 mg  TID

Epogen 3000 units sq qwk

Colace 100 mg  BID



Family history   Notable for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.



Social history   He was previously the head statistical programmer for electronic data systems for many years and now disabled.  He is married and has a daughter.  Cigarettes, none times years.  Alcohol, previously heavy.  There was a history of previous illicit drug use.



Review of systems   Since he has been home, he has done reasonably well though he has noted increasing leg edema bilaterally with a significant weight gain.  He denies chest pain or palpitations.  He denies shortness of breath.  He has not been vomiting, and he actually self-discontinued both OxyContin and methadone because he felt that they did not make him feel well.



Physical examination

Pulse   86 per minute

Blood pressure 150/90    Today, 150/90 then 144/86

Weight   185 pounds

Heent   Eyes, ears, nose, and pharynx are normal, but dentition is poor

Neck   No bruits

Nodes   None palpable

Chest   Lungs, clear

Cor   Regular rate and rhythm without murmur

Abdomen   Benign

Extrem   With 3+ massive edema

Neuro   Abnormal gait due to peripheral neuropathy



Assessment and plan   Leg edema is uncertainly due to his vasodilators.  We will discontinue hydralazine and Norvasc.  He has already stopped his OxyContin and methadone.  We will see him back in approximately two weeks to follow up on his blood pressure.  He will have routine laboratory studies done today.

EDVISIT^91464150^Godwin, Yair^04/24/76^MURRAY, MARION OSCAR

The patient was interviewed and examined primarily by me.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right chest wall pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male

who presents to Bowne Hospital Emergency Department with no

one-week history of right-sided lateral chest wall pain.  The

patient states the pain is worse with movement including

stretching, bending, and reaching.  The patient states that

patient had slept with a hot water bottle on his right chest wall

for pain relief and had pain relief and was sitting in a chair. 

His lying down on his right side was painful, and this morning,

sat up and while getting up, exacerbated the chest wall pain. 

The patient discussed this pain with his primary care physician

during the past 2 weeks and who had been in agreement that it is

probable muscle strain.  The patient denies any headache, visual

changes, and dizziness.  Denies any neck pain.  Denies any

left-sided chest pain.  Denies any nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,

or dyspnea.  Denies any abdominal pain.  He has been afebrile. 

No cough.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes hypertension and non-insulin

dependent diabetes.  The patient also has exposure to asbestos

and asbestos changes on CT scan previously.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past tobacco, past ETOH, no IV drug abuse, lives

with his family, and he is retired.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated in the history of present

illness, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  See nursing note for full list of medications.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known allergies to medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert in no acute

distress.  Temperature 95.4, pulse of 67, respiratory rate of 16,

blood pressure 179/78, and O2 saturation 95% on room air.  HEENT

is atraumatic.  ENT:  No infection.  Pharynx is normal.  Neck is

supple and nontender.  Respiratory exam:  Chest wall is tender. 

Patient has reproducible, palpable right-sided posterior lateral

and anterior lateral chest wall tenderness.  Normal breath sounds

bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac exam: 

Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, and normal pulses throughout.

 Abdomen is soft.  The patient has some minimal amount of right

upper quadrant tenderness just subcostal at the infracostal

margin.  No rebound or guarding.  Skin is warm, dry, and intact,

no lesions, or rashes.  Extremities are nontender. Normal range

of motion.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologic exam: 

Cranial nerves II through XII intact bilaterally.  No motor or

sensory deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for white count of 10.6, hematocrit

of 38.5, platelets of 244,000.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.1,

chloride of 105, bicarbonate 23, BUN 38, creatinine 1.9, and

glucose of 165.  ALT of 11, AST of 16, amylase of 71, and lipase

61.

Given the fact that the patient had some right upper quadrant

pain and pain was radiating laterally to the right anterior

aspect, patient received a right upper quadrant ultrasound, which

was negative.  No evidence of stones or gallbladder changes,

consistent with cholecystitis.  The patient had a chest x-ray,

which showed no new changes from prior studies.  No evidence of

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

The patient received morphine IV, and subsequently received 2

Percocet tablets, and had resolution of his pain.  Patient's case

was discussed with Dr. Rivers, who is the patient's primary care

physician, and who is in agreement to discharge the patient home

with pain medications and muscle relaxants.  The patient is being

discharged home in satisfactory condition.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Right chest wall pain.

CXR:

FINDINGS:

	No infiltrates or evidence of CHF is present.  There is a three cm

	mass in the right lower lung.  This was shown to be rounded

	atelectasis on chest CT.  Pleural changes are consistent with

	asbestos related pleural disease.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Asbestos related pleural disease

	Right lower lobe mass shown to be rounded atelectasis on chest CT.

CT Chest	

	FINDINGS:

	No comparison.  The aorta is of normal caliber.  There is

	atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.  Classic arch anatomy

	is present.

	Bilateral pleural calcific plaques are demonstrated consistent

	with asbestos related pleural disease.  In addition, in the

	posterior segment right lower lobe there is 2.7 cm mass.  The mass

	has a linear pleural attachment adjacent to pleural plaques.

	There is also present swirling vessels around the mass and volume

	loss.  The findings are consistent with rounded atelectasis.  A

	smaller focus of rounded atelectasis is present in the left lower

	lobe.

	Coronary artery calcifications present.  No mediastinal or hilar

	or axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  There is no

	supraclavicular adenopathy.

	The osseous structures are unremarkable.

	Please see dictated abdomen report.

	



IMPRESSION:

	1.  Normal caliber aorta please see MRA report regarding

	evaluation of dissection.

	2.  Bilateral rounded atelectasis and asbestos related pleural

	disease.

	

	



   WMC  MRA AORTA + &  01-Aug-2076 09:10 





REPORT:

	This study was reviewed with Dr. Upshur.

	MRA OF THE THORAX WAS WITH AND WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.

	Technique: Standard departmental MRA protocol of the chest and

	upper abdomen was performed with and without gadolinium. 3-D

	images were obtained and interpreted.

	Findings:

	There is a three vessel aortic arch.  There is no evidence of a

	flap within the aorta to suggest a dissection. The takeoffs of the

	great vessels are normally patent. There is no evidence of

	aneurysm.

	The celiac artery and SMA are patent. There are single renal

	arteries bilaterally.  There is mild narrowing of the proximal

	right renal artery.  The left renal artery is patent.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Unremarkable MRA of the thoracic aorta, without evidence of

	dissection or aneurysm.

	Mild narrowing of the proximal right renal artery.

EKG:

Old left bundle branch block, normal sinus 66. 



CXR:

FINDINGS:

	No infiltrates or evidence of CHF is present.  There is a three cm

	mass in the right lower lung.  This was shown to be rounded

	atelectasis on chest CT.  Pleural changes are consistent with

	asbestos related pleural disease.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Asbestos related pleural disease

	Right lower lobe mass shown to be rounded atelectasis on chest CT.

	

CT:



CT Chest	

	FINDINGS:

	No comparison.  The aorta is of normal caliber.  There is

	atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.  Classic arch anatomy

	is present.

	Bilateral pleural calcific plaques are demonstrated consistent

	with asbestos related pleural disease.  In addition, in the

	posterior segment right lower lobe there is 2.7 cm mass.  The mass

	has a linear pleural attachment adjacent to pleural plaques.

	There is also present swirling vessels around the mass and volume

	loss.  The findings are consistent with rounded atelectasis.  A

	smaller focus of rounded atelectasis is present in the left lower

	lobe.

	Coronary artery calcifications present.  No mediastinal or hilar

	or axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  There is no

	supraclavicular adenopathy.

	The osseous structures are unremarkable.

	Please see dictated abdomen report.

	



IMPRESSION:

	1.  Normal caliber aorta please see MRA report regarding

	evaluation of dissection.

	2.  Bilateral rounded atelectasis and asbestos related pleural

	disease.

	

	



   [HOSPITAL]  MRA AORTA + &  [DATE] 09:10 





REPORT:

	This study was reviewed with Dr. [DOCTOR].

	MRA OF THE THORAX WAS WITH AND WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.

	Technique: Standard departmental MRA protocol of the chest and

	upper abdomen was performed with and without gadolinium. 3-D

	images were obtained and interpreted.

	Findings:

	There is a three vessel aortic arch.  There is no evidence of a

	flap within the aorta to suggest a dissection. The takeoffs of the

	great vessels are normally patent. There is no evidence of

	aneurysm.

	The celiac artery and SMA are patent. There are single renal

	arteries bilaterally.  There is mild narrowing of the proximal

	right renal artery.  The left renal artery is patent.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Unremarkable MRA of the thoracic aorta, without evidence of

	dissection or aneurysm.

	Mild narrowing of the proximal right renal artery.

Impression: 71M hx DM, HTN, HLP, p/w chest pain likely GI related and not cardiac in origin.



Plan: 

1.	chest pain: Unlikely cardiac in origin given negative EKG, recent normal stress test, and atypical nature. Likely GI related as pt with dry heaving around time of chest tightness.

-cont asa, simvastatin, atenolol, irbesartan, and lasix

-repeat EKG in AM

-cycle cardiac enzymes, telemetry

-check lipid panel

-maalox prn



2.	decreased visual acuity: Most likely worsening macular degeneration given recent chronic history of symptoms. Absence of pain makes retinal vascular occlusion very unlikely, no other neurological symptoms to indicate CVA. 

-refer pt back to MVH once ruled out for MI

-consider I- CT if more neuro symptoms develop to r/o acute stroke



3.	Diabetes: -check lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c

-RISS, glipizide

-hold pioglitazone (not in formulary)



4.	proph: nexium, heparin

EKG: NSR. LBBB. 1mm STD I/II/aVf/V5-6. 2mm STE V1-3. TWI I, biphasic T-wave V5-6. (No change from prior ekg)



Impression: [AGE]M hx DM, HTN, HLP, p/w chest pain likely GI related and not cardiac in origin.



Plan: 

1.	chest pain: Unlikely cardiac in origin given negative EKG, recent normal stress test, and atypical nature. Likely GI related as pt with dry heaving around time of chest tightness.

-cont asa, simvastatin, atenolol, irbesartan, and lasix

-repeat EKG in AM

-cycle cardiac enzymes, telemetry

-check lipid panel

-maalox prn



2.	decreased visual acuity: Most likely worsening macular degeneration given recent chronic history of symptoms. Absence of pain makes retinal vascular occlusion very unlikely, no other neurological symptoms to indicate CVA. 

-refer pt back to [HOSPITAL] once ruled out for MI

-consider I- CT if more neuro symptoms develop to r/o acute stroke



3.	Diabetes: -check lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c

-RISS, glipizide

-hold pioglitazone (not in formulary)



4.	proph: nexium, heparin

HPI: Patient is a 75 y/o M, a former smoker, with Hx of multiple medical problems including macular degeneration in the R eye, CAD, NIDDM, HTN and hypercholesterolemia.  A month ago he first noticed what he describes as &#8220;blue floaties&#8221; in the LLQ of his L eye&#8217;s visual field.  He then saw his ophthalmologist at the Shenandoah Hospital in Parchman who concluded that this is not due to macular degeneration.  He denies having headaches or any other symptoms at that time.  He denies similar episodes of &#8220;floaties&#8221; in the past and he has no Hx of headaches, disarthria, motor deficits, sensory loss and has never been hospitalized with a stroke or TIA.  He recalls having &#8220;high kidney function&#8221; in the past, but does not recall details.

Patient Name: YOUNT, PATRICIA;  MRN: 4711083
Dictated at: 03/08/2088 by BRANDON VICENTE, M.D. 

RENAL CONSULT NOTE 
 
It is a pleasure seeing seeing Ms. Yount in consultation.  She was referred to us by Dr. Michael.  Ms. Yount has a history of diabetes mellitus for the last seven years.  She also has a long history of hypertension.  She retired from IBM in 2085 after working there for many years.  Her last posting was as a electrical mechanic.  She is feeling well.  She denies headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  She also denies shortness of breath or complex partial seizures.  She denies swelling and presence of dysuria, fever, chills.  She is taking her medications regularly.  
 
ALLERGIES 
No known drug allergies.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 
1.  Diabetes mellitus for about seven years.  
2.  Hypertension.  

3.  PVD

4.  Hypercholesterolemia

 
SOCIAL HISTORY 
She denies smoking or drinking.  She has one son living with her.


FAMILY HISTORY 
Positive for diabetes.  
 
MEDICATIONS 
Norvasc 10 mg q. day,

Glucophage 500 mg twice a day,

Glucotrol 5 mg twice a day,

Avandia 4 mg q. day, (she had incresed skin itching with attempts to increase the dose)

Lipitor 10 mg q. day,

Aspirin 325 mg a day (she is not taking aspirin).   


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS 
Ms. Yount denies any recent visual change, headaches.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, fever, chills.   


PHYSICAL EXAM 
Ms. Yount looks well.  Blood pressure is 148/90.  Body weight is 188.  Repeat blood pressure is 170/80.  On examination of head and neck - no absolutely.  Thyroid is soft, nontender, no nodules.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart - regular rate and rhythm, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present.  Extremities - trace edema.  
 
LABORATORY 
Pending.  
 
IMPRESSION 
Ms. Yount has diabetes and hypertension with a mildly elevated creatinine.  Her urine shows presence of protein, which suggests diabetic nephropathy.  Upon review of her medications, she is on a very good medication control, and  her blood pressure has been well controlled.  However, today the blood pressure is running higher.  I will see her in about two to three months.  If her blood pressure continues to be high, we should try to increase her dose of ARB.  I also explained to Ms. Yount the importance of taking aspirin and that she should continue her daily aspirin.

Dictated on: 10/24/2088 by YOEL NEWCOMB, M.D. 



 

Patricia is a 70-year-old retired woman, right-hand dominant, who comes with complaints of soreness in her right wrist.  She apparently had a fall, which caused substantial pain and some swelling, but no bruising.  Brought her in to have an evaluation.  X-rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially, and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors, but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.  

 

Past medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.  

 

No prior surgeries.  

 

No medications.  

 

No known drug allergies.  

 

Lists no family history of any problems.  

 

Lives alone and used to smoke, but quit.  

 

On examination, she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side.  No atrophy, ecchymosis, edema or deformity.  Negative scaphoid shift test.  Slight tenderness over the distal radius.  Normal tendon function.  

 

My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.

My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.

2/04/2092

Admission Note

HPI: 73 year old woman with hypertension, DM, peripheral vascular disease presents with dyspnea on exertion for 2 days. Th patient was well and normally active with walking and usual activities without DOE until 2 days ago. Last routine visit was in 9/91 w/ her PCP and was fine. 2 days ago noted DOE when going to store. This persisted w/ activity only. The patient was fine at rest and was able to sleep without difficulty. There were no recent changes in her meds. She had no other symptoms including CP, dizziness, URI symptoms, fever, chills, GI symptoms. No PND, orthopnea.



She previously had a cardiac evaluation during a similar presentation in 2085. She had a low level stress test and echocardiogram. No ischemia was demonstrated at a very minimal exertion. The echo showed LVH and an EF of 61%. Because of an impending snow storm, she decided to come to the hospital for evaluation. In the ED her BP was elevated and her 02 sat was only 78% on RA.



PMH:

1. Diabetes mellitus: on medical regimen, HgA1c 7.3 (9/91).



2. Hypertension: Blood pressure is 140/72.  Echocardiogram 12/85 - EF 61%, LVH. ETT 12/85 - 4 METS, no wall motion abnormalities.



3. Hypercholesterolemia: on Lipitor 10, LDL 78 (4/91).



4. Peripheral vascular disease: arterial studies 10/90 - left SFA occlusion, and bilateral distal popliteal/ tibial

vessel disease.  She is well collateralized across the ankles at rest and poorly collateralized across the ankles post exercise.  Perfusion is adequate to the TM level, and poor to the digital level, bilaterally



5. Anemia: normocytic normochromic anemia with a normal SPEP and UPEP and iron studies. Baseline hematocrit of low 30's.



6. Obesity. 



7. Osteopenia with a history of right radial fracture.



MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

Tenormin 150mg po bid

Glucotrol 5mg PO as directed 2 tab po qam, 1 tab po qpm Cozaar 100mg po QD

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergy.



SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives in Glencoe. Has one son. Originally from Clearlake. Previously worked as a engineer at IBM research, retried a few yrs ago. Exercises twice a wk for 1/2 hour, aerobic exercises and treadmill at the gym.



FAMILY HISTORY: Father has DM. One sister diabetes father - diabetes. Sister - diabetes..



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative in detail except as otherwise noted.

02/04/92 Superstat APTT 29.1, 

02/04/92 NT-proBNP 1086 H



CXR (AP): No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.



CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries.  However, evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is suboptimal due to respiratory motion. 2. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis. 3. Small right pleural effusion. 4. Intravenous contrast noted within the hepatic veins which could be secondary to CHF.



EKG: NSR, LVH, 1st degree AVB, nonspecific ST, TW changes.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old woman with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia who presents with exertional dyspnea. The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF. The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear. More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI. Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT. Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion. Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process? If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative. Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles. Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms. Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.

HPI: please refer to prior d/c summaries (April and May 2092) for details of PMHx.  Patricia is a 73 yo female from Clearlake with a recent diagnosis of pulmonary venoocclusive disease by bx in 4/92 with chronic hypoxia on n/c oxygen, diastolic dysfunction, HTN, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency and hyperlipidemia.  She was discharged from SBH in 4/92 and had spent some time at PMSC prior to that.  Has been doing fairly well at home over the last few months but presented with increasing shortness of breath. Denies chest pain,n/v/f/chills/cough, new orthopnea or edema or wt gain. She'd been seen 2-3 weeks ago in the ED with similar symptoms and was successfully treated with IV lasix and sent home.  Yesterday she was admitted to ED obs unit but because of persistent hypoxia and concern she is being transfered to medical service. 



In ED/obs unit given IV lasix, albuterol (stopped d/t short run of Vtach).

Impression:  pulmonary veno occulsive disease, diastolic dysfunction with mild CHF exacerbation.  Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.  Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.



Plan:



--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.

--complete cycling enzymes

--continue outpatient lasix dose.

--adjust n/c oxygen as needed

--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.

-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.

-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)

-- OOB to chair, ambulate with assistance.

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.

-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.

-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)

-- OOB to chair, ambulate with assistance.

She's doing much better from her painful R facial weakness (? Ramsay Hunt syndrome).  She di dnot take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds.  Her R eye ""tears a lot"", at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she's masticating), and occasionally it burns....but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge.  She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds she""pockets"" food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.

The pain has receded-  she now only gets ""a twinge"" now and then.



Husband has noticed she's not hearing quite as well.



Her current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd.  She's releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8



On exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ok0on wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining tabloe with only contact guard. Dense catarcts; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. Cornelas are brisk pilaterally, but she has decreased sensationon the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + Bell's phenomenon.  She hears finger rub at 90 cm on R, 70 cm on L; Weber lateralizes to the R, but Rinne' positive bilatyerally (ie, AC>BC AU). Tongue midline.  Modulates voice well.  TMs opaque, but EACs clear.



She has a marked polyneuropathy, with decreased vibration from knuckles to elbows bilaterally Hyporeflexia throughout, but symmetrical.  Strength remains well conserved.



IMP: improving R Bell's. MRI showed much motion, but no gross abnormalities



Plan- continue with current management. I'd welcome the oportunity of seeing her again in about 6 months.

Patient Name: FALLON, SHARON;  MRN: 1703242
Dictated on: 11/11/2074 by PATRICIA DRAKE, N.P., PH.D. 

 
HISTORY:  Mrs. Fallon returns to clinic for evaluation and management of a right posterior ankle ulceration.  Since her last visit to the clinic, she was evaluated by Dr. Frederick Archer who admitted her for a diagnostic angiogram, which revealed that she had adequate perfusion to the ankle level 
to heal the ulceration.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, Mrs. Fallon has ruborous discoloration of the distal half of her bilateral lower extremity with scattered vesicles on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity.  The 
ulceration is on the posterior aspect of the right ankle.  It measured 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm.  The tissue is moist yellow subcutaneous tissue, the margin is clear.  In the setting of ruborous discoloration, it appears that Mrs. Fallon may have an acute flare of her chronic lipodermatosclerosis.   
PLAN:  Daily wound care per the following protocol; 1.  Normal saline irrigation 30 cc x 3.  A thin layer of 50% Diprolene ointment 0.05% with Bactroban cream to the wound bed and the wide periwound margin.  Primary dressing will be Telfa covered with rolled gauze.  Mrs. Fallon will return to clinic in 2 weeks unless the wound bed is closed and then she will follow up with Dr. Archer on Tuesday, November 26th.

MITRAL VALVE

There is evidence of thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet.  There is

calcification of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus.  There is no

evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  The peak transmitral gradient is 10 mmHg.

The mean transmitral gradient is 5 mmHg.  There is mild to moderate mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM

The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or

spectral Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function approaches the lower limits of normal.  There is symmetric left

ventricular hypertrophy.  There is segmental apical left ventricular

dysfunction (see wall motion plot).  There is no evidence of left ventricular

thrombus.  The estimated ejection fraction is 51 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is a space between

visceral and parietal pericardium most c/w pericardial fat.



CONCLUSIONS

Compared to the study of 9/12/73, the EF has dropped by 10% and apical wall

motion abnormalities are now noted.





CCU Course/Plan	

72 year old woman with ESRD, positive troponin in setting SOB and pulmonary oedema on CXR. Suspect  leak  from demand.  



1)	ischemia: ASA, BB. Would doubt she needs urgent cath but will hold NPO for potential cath in am.  Would not add heparin. Check fasting lipids.



2)	rhythm: so far not an issue. BB as tolerated. 



3)	pump: she has LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction.  Would prefer to have ACE on board - will d/w renal as to why not.



4)	ESRD - can go for HD today. Need to contact dialysis unit to arrange time.



5)	DM 2 - SSI for now, will likely give back Lantus tonight. She is v reluctant to have SSI, will give at half usual doses.



6)	FEN cardiac, diabetic diet. Hold NPO pending possible cath in am.



7)	Prophylaxis: GI: Nexium, DVT: Heparin IV; BM: prn. 



8)	Dispo - to SDU today

MITRAL VALVE

There is evidence of thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet.  There is

calcification of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus.  There is no

evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  The peak transmitral gradient is 10 mmHg.

The mean transmitral gradient is 5 mmHg.  There is mild to moderate mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM

The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or

spectral Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function approaches the lower limits of normal.  There is symmetric left

ventricular hypertrophy.  There is segmental apical left ventricular

dysfunction (see wall motion plot).  There is no evidence of left ventricular

thrombus.  The estimated ejection fraction is 51 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is a space between

visceral and parietal pericardium most c/w pericardial fat.



CONCLUSIONS

Compared to the study of [DATE], the EF has dropped by 10% and apical wall

motion abnormalities are now noted.





CCU Course/Plan	

[AGE] year old woman with ESRD, positive troponin in setting SOB and pulmonary oedema on CXR. Suspect  leak  from demand.  



1)	ischemia: ASA, BB. Would doubt she needs urgent cath but will hold NPO for potential cath in am.  Would not add heparin. Check fasting lipids.



2)	rhythm: so far not an issue. BB as tolerated. 



3)	pump: she has LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction.  Would prefer to have ACE on board - will d/w renal as to why not.



4)	ESRD - can go for HD today. Need to contact dialysis unit to arrange time.



5)	DM 2 - SSI for now, will likely give back Lantus tonight. She is v reluctant to have SSI, will give at half usual doses.



6)	FEN cardiac, diabetic diet. Hold NPO pending possible cath in am.



7)	Prophylaxis: GI: Nexium, DVT: Heparin IV; BM: prn. 



8)	Dispo - to SDU today

CC:  73 yo woman admitted with recurrent hypotension preventing hemodialysis



HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time. Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.  Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position. She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea. She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain. Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.



PMH: ESRD as a result of DM on HD, DM related retinopathy/neuropathy; h/o infected tunneled catheter; hyperparathyroidism; HTN in the past; CAD s/p NSTEMI 12/74, echo in Jan 2074 showed EF 52%; CHF;  PVD with RLE ulcer followed by Dr. Archer; h/o  GI bleed with negative upper endoscopy , pending colonoscopy, umbilical and hiatal hernia, cervical CA 6 years ago s/p hysterectomy; gout; benign breast tumor; h/o DVT s/p filter placement; h/ hypercalcemia, depression



PSH: TAH 6 years ago; left arm AV fistula s/p thrombectomy x 2, most recently one week ago



Medications: Allopurinol 200 po qd, Mevacor 20 po qd, Quinine 350 po BID, Concerta 3 tabs qd, Colace, Pericolace, Tylenol #3 prn, Nephrocaps 1 tab po qd, ASA 81 po qd, Lantus insulin 50 units qam, Tums 1 tab po tid with meals

Alternative meds: None

Allergies: MSO4 cause SOB; Novocaine causes seizure



Family history: Non-contributory



Social history: Lives at home with husband of 34 years, two children from previous marriage live in the area, has grandchildren. Used to work in construction.



Risks: Never use tobacco, rarely used alcohol, no injection drug use



Review of systems: (+) some vaginal blood spotting recently. No recent HA, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, abdominal pain.



PE: Elderly, pale woman in NAD. T 97.7 degrees, BP 117/62, HR 84, RR 24, Sat 99% on RA. HEENT: NC,ST, PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, non-injected, arcus senilis no oto/rhinorrhea, oral mucosa moist, no cervical LAD or tenderness, no thyromegaly, neck supple, no supraclavicular LAD or bruits. HEART- RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no S3, S4 or murmur. PULM- CTA bilaterally with moderate to good BS bilaterally, no wheeze, rales or rhonchi. ABD- soft, NT, ND, BS+, reducible herniano HSM or masses, no aortic, hepatic or renal bruits. EXT- Bilateral brawny edema of LE. SKIN- changes if chronic venous statis of LE with tender shallow fissure of left heel. NEURO- A/O x 3, conversant, well-formed sentences, appropriate although somewhat flat, but laughed occasionally, CN 2-12 intact, visual fields intact bilaterally, DTRs 1+ and symmetric in triceps, biceps, quads and achilles, strength 4/5 bilateral U and LE



Data: Na 136, K 5.6, Cl 96, HCO3 29, BUN 69, Cr 10.2, Glu 96, Ca 9.3, PO4 6.9, Mg 2.0, Alb 2.9; WBC 12.2 no diff, HCT 32.7, PLT 247; PT 13.5, PTT 24



ECG: NSR with occasional ectopy, RBBB and 1st degree AV block, no e/o ischemia or infarction



Imaging:  CXR today shows pulmonary venous hypertension with interstitial edema and small pleural effusions bilaterally. Patchy opacity at the left lung base most likely represents alveolar edema or atelectasis.



CODE status: Unknown



Focused problem list:  Hypotension limiting hemodialysis s/p MI 3 months ago, DM, neuropathy, depression



A/P: 73 year old woman with likely autonomic instability resulting from long-standing diabetes. In order to effectively counter the level of hypotension that she experiences after HD, she may benefit from interventions that will raise the systemic BP.



1)	Blood pressure

-   Adenosine-stress MIBI today

-	If the above is OK, plant to start midodrine 5 mg po tid



2)	Renal failure

-   Check lytes in AM

-	To HD in AM

-	Already received kayexalate in EW tonight

-	Increase Tums to 2 tabs po tid with meals for hyperphosphatemia



3)	Vaginal spotting

-   Pt has a gynecologist here at RH, will contact re: imaging vs other, esp in setting of h/o cervical CA

-	HCT stable

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Leg fracture. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 41 year-old woman, 
transferred from Otis Hospital where she presented today 
after falling in her kitchen.  She states she lost her footing 
while wearing some high heel shoes and fell in a twisting motion, 
sustaining an injury to her foot and ankle.  She was seen at 
Otis Hospital where an open tib-fib fracture was identified. 
She denied any other injury.  She denied head injury, neck pain, 
back pain, or chest pain. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for insulin requiring diabetes and 
hypertension, as well as renal insufficiency. 
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Cozaar, Lipitor, Lasix, and Procan. 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  She does admit to drinking 
tonight and on a fairly regular basis. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Alert and oriented.  She did have 
the odor of alcohol on her breath.  HEAD:  Atraumatic.  NECK:  Full 
range of motion, non-tender.  CHEST:  Clavicles and chest were 
non-tender.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  HEART:  Normal S1 and 
S2.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender.  PELVIS & EXTREMITIES: 
Unremarkable with the exception of the right ankle, which is in a 
plaster splint.  When removed laceration was seen just proximal to 
the medial malleolus.  There was a normal pulse and capillary 
refill in the extremity. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  X-rays revealed a fracture underlying the 
laceration of the tibia.  There was also a distal fibular fracture 
as well.  The mortise appeared intact.  Chest x-ray was clear. 
Electrocardiogram is pending.  Laboratory studies showed a normal 
CBC, glucose of 291, and creatinine of 1.9 from the other facility. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient will be taken to the 
operating room for wash-out and open reduction and internal 
fixation procedure. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Open tib-fib fracture. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
presently in stable condition.

Xanders, Ruth

MR #564-19-92-7

December 16, 2081

 

Ms. Xanders is a 42-year-old woman with multiple medical problems who

presents for evaluation of chronic hepatitis C.  She reports having

had a blood transfusion in 2059 and has had no history of other

percutaneous exposure including intravenous drug use.  She has had

normal transaminases in the past but a positive hepatitis C

antibody test.  She reports no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting,

anorexia or weight loss, no diarrhea, constipation, melena or

bright red blood per rectum.  She has had no fevers, chills,

sweats, arthralgias, myalgias or skin rash, epistaxis, easy

bruising or bleeding gums and she has no insomnia or episodes of

confusion.  She reports a generally good energy level with some

mild fatigue.  

 

Past Medical History:

     1.  Hypertension.

     2.  Diabetes.

     3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

     4.  Hyperlipidemia.

 

Current Medications:  Humulin NPH 20 units qAM, 15 qPM, Humulin

Regular insulin 3 units qAM, 5 qPM, Lipitor 40 mg po q.h.s.,

Procrit 3,000 units sub q. bi week, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Quinine

260 mg po q.h.s. and Hyzaar 100/25 mg po q. day as well as Naftin

prn.

 

Allergies:  Lisinopril causes cough.

 

Family History:  No history of liver disease or GI malignancies.  

Social History:  She continues to smoke but has cut back recently

and she drinks alcohol approximately once a week to once every two

weeks.  

 

Review of systems otherwise negative for HEENT, cardiovascular,

respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal or neurological systems.

 

On exam, she is a well-appearing woman in no acute distress.  Pulse

80 and regular, blood pressure 152/76, weight 151 pounds.  HEENT

she is anicteric with equal, round, reactive pupils and normal

conjunctivae.  Oropharynx reveals no ulcers or icterus.  Neck

reveals no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest is clear to

auscultation and percussion.  Heart reveals a regular rate and

rhythm, S1 and S2 are present without murmur, rub or gallop.  

Xanders, Ruth

MR #564-19-92-7               -2-            December 16, 2081

 

Abdomen is soft, nontender and non-distended with no

hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremities reveal no clubbing,

cyanosis or edema.  

 

Most recent labs from October 22, 2081 reveal an ALT of 13, AST 19,

alkaline phosphatase 78, bilirubin 0.3, creatinine 3.1, albumin

3.6.  

 

Impression:  Ms. Xanders has a history of a positive hepatitis C

antibody with normal LFT's.  Today, we will check a hepatitis C RNA

level to see if she is in fact viremic or whether she is one of the

lucky 15% of people who clear the virus but remain antibody

positive.  If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than

she requires no further workup.  However, if she is RNA positive

than I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of

inflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for

treatment with interferon/ribavirin.  She is amenable to this and

we will follow-up in two weeks by phone to discuss the results of

her RNA test.

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Hypertension.
2. Pedal edema.
3. Diabetes.

HPI: Ruth is a 42 year old woman who presents for follow
up of medical issues as well as for new pedal edema over the
past 2 weeks.  When I saw her a few weeks ago, she was very
dehydrated and required a decrease in dose of her Lasix due
to symptoms of dehydration as well as a rise in her
creatinine and BUN.  She responded well to this and then did
well for a week or so.  Then she saw Dr. Vuong who
increased her dose of Lasix back to 20 mg in the evening. 
Subsequently, she developed pedal edema which, at times, is
up to her knees and has been very bothersome for her.  Of
note, she started Norvasc within the past few months and it
was gradually increased to 10 mg a day.  She reports her
blood sugars have been under excellent control, ranging from
90-120s-140s especially over the past couple of weeks.  She
has had a couple of lows in the 40s over the past couple of
months.  She again has not yet followed up with Dr. Vicki
Klein as I had recommended for help with her diabetes.  She
reports her blood pressure in Dr. Vuong's office was
normal as well.  She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased
shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.  No fever or
chills.  Remainder review of systems negative.  She does
report sweating with meals that she is unsure how long she
has had but has noted it over the past few months. 

MEDICATIONS: As noted in the record and confirmed.

ALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes cough.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant woman in no acute
distress.  Her skin is very tanned.  Blood pressure 148/62,
on repeat it is 160/70, pulse of 88, weight of 150, weight
is up about 6 pounds for her.  HEENT within normal limits. 
Neck: no JVD.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no
crackles or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular exam: normal S1, S2,
II/VI systolic murmur at right sternal border.  Abdomen is
benign.  Extremities: she has 1-2+ pitting pedal edema to
mid shin.  

IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 42 year old woman with:
1. New pedal edema.  Reviewing patient's recent lab results,
she does have proteinuria but it is actually improved since
the last time it was checked and also her creatinine has
improved.  I believe the pedal edema may be related to the
Norvasc.  Therefore, I advised her to stop the Norvasc and
she will call me tomorrow to let me know how she is doing as
it may take a few days to resolve.  Will consider increasing
her Lasix based on how she responds to discontinuing the
Norvasc and her labs.  Will check basic metabolic panel and
urinalysis as well.
2. Hypertension since discontinuing Norvasc.  Will start
atenolol in a low dose but advised her not to start this for
the next few days.  Will start at 12.5 mg a day and increase
to 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks
for a repeat blood pressure check.
3. Diabetes.  The patient is strongly encouraged to make an
appointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to
see if there is anything more we can do to change her
insulin regimen.  

The patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and
otherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and
sooner if no resolution of her pedal edema.

Dear Quin,

Just a note for the records regarding Ms. Xanders's recent admission to our Cardiology Service between 08/09/2087 and 08/12/2087.  As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083. She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.  She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.  An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads.  Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.

At the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization.  Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.

Coronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.  There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.  After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully.  She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained ""stable"" in the mid 20s.  She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.

She understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year.

It was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.  A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.

With best regards.

Sincerely yours,

Xiomara B Xanthos M.D. 
53 Barrington Avenue, Suite 700
Connell, MO 38438

Dear Dr. Xanthos:

  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Milton Horne in my office today for evaluation of coronary artery disease.  As you know, he is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary disease, admitted to GMH in June 2077 after a non-ST-elevation MI, and had a bare-metal stent placed in his LAD.  He has done well since that procedure.  He denies any exertional chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, pedal edema, lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.

Medications:
Aspirin 325 mg daily.
Atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
Metoprolol 100 mg daily.
Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily.
Plavix 75 mg daily.
Nexium 40 mg daily.


	Past medical history:
   Significant for,
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Basal cell carcinoma.
Gastroesophageal reflux.
Umbilical hernia.
Hypertension.
Hyperlipidemia.
Coronary artery disease.


	Family history:
   Significant for brother had an MI at age 68.  Father who had MIs in his 60s and a coronary artery bypass grafting.  Mother never had coronary disease.


	Social history:
   He is single.  Never married.  No children.  He never smoked.  He drinks one to two drinks a week.  He denies illicit drugs.  He also works as a Recruitment Officer.

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   60 and regular
-BP: 110/60  
-resp. rate:   16 and unlabored
-General:   He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Oriented x 3
-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline
-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water
-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes
-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border
-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly
-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 1+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis

Selected recent labs:

	 Last cholesterol was, 07/06/2077, showed total cholesterol 174, triglycerides 111, HDL 44, and LDL 108.
	


	Other Data:
   The patient underwent exercise tolerance testing in August 2077 and was able to exercise for 6 minutes.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear images showed no evidence of ischemia or previous infarct.  LV function was normal.
EKG today shows normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, right bundle-branch block, and an old IMI.


	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, this is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who had an MI in June 2077, which was a non-ST-elevation MI.  He underwent stenting of his LAD.  Since that time, he has not had any exertional angina.  He has no evidence of fluid retention or decompensated congestive heart failure.  Blood pressure is fine today.  Cholesterol is not perfect, but acceptable.  He is on a high dose of atorvastatin.  He is on a good medical regimen and at this point, I would keep him on his current medicines and plan to see him back in another six months.  He would like to enter a Cardiac Rehab Program and I think that certainly is a reasonable thing to do.

As always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.

Best personal regards,

Sincerely yours,

	Interval History:
   Roger Easterling, M.D. 
27 Caroll St, #734 
Bluefield, ME 12111 

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service on 10/28/2078. He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis. He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning. 

His episodes of chest pain are interesting. He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching. The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset. They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge. He is otherwise in fairly good health.


	Past medical history:
   1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis 
2) Palpitations 
3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

	

	Allergies:
	
No known drug allergy


	Medications (Confirmed):

	
aspirin  81 mg po daily
penicillin VK  500 mg po 4 x day


	Family history:
   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. 


	Social history:
   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.

Habits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.


	Review of systems:
   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.

Physical examination:
	
-BP: 110/70  
-Pulse: 59  BPM regular
-resp. rate: 16  unlabored
-Skin:   without lesions or nodules.
-HEENT:   EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Mucous membranes moist.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
-Neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure &lt;5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline.
-Chest:   lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion.
-Cardiac:   regular with a normal S1/S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
-Abdomen:   soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses.
-Extremities:   no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
-Neuro:   reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.


	EKG:
   10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.


	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort. Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se. It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past. 

We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed. 

I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress. 

Yours truly, 

Norman C. Ivers, M.D.

It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past. 

We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed. 

I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress. 

Yours truly, 

[DOCTOR], M.D.

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of rapid heart action. At his last visit we gave him a 30-day loop event recorder for arrhythmia surveillance due to palpitations. Since that point he has transmitted events showing rapid atrial fibrillation up to 160 Bpm associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping. These episodes occur on a random basis and last up to 45 minutes. He does not identify any precipitating factors and symptoms resolve spontaneously. He denies dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, lightheadedness, pre syncope or syncope. He reportedly has had a negative stress test and echocardiogram. He is not on any medications. He has never been on Coumadin. 


	Past medical history:
   1. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 
2. Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatitis 
3. Palpitations 
4. Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation. We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. 

We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment. We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily. If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation. We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management. He has a CHAD2 Score of 0. We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time. 

We will complete diagnostic testing, follow up with the results and then proceed. We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns, or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

27 Caroll St, #734 
Bluefield, ME 12111 

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of atrial fibrillation to discuss findings on recent SESTA MIBI. As you know, he is a 52-year-old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation. Episodes have been associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping and we therefore had him complete nuclear stress test and echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. He is on Toprol XL 50 mg and aspirin. SESTA MIBI completed January 5, 2079 after 11 minutes, 13 METS and 90 MPHR was positive ischemia by ECG demonstrated by 2 mm ST depressions in leads II, AVF, and V6 and 2.5 mm ST depressions in leads III and V5. Myocardial scans showed mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia with EF 66%. He had no symptoms and there were occasional VPCs and PACs. Echocardiogram was normal with exception to mildly dilated LA 40 mm. 

Since his last visit he has had two additional of episodes of atrial fibrillation with complaint of rapid heart action, jaw pain and chest discomfort. The episodes lasted approximately 10 minutes and were relieved by rest. He denied lightheadedness, dizziness, pre syncope, syncope, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note they occurred this time with exercise as opposed to at rest and they seemed more severe in nature.

	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ischemia noted on recent SESTA MIBI. We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention. We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications, cardiac perforation, renal complications, stroke, heart attack, and death. He understands and has agreed to proceed. We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation. He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation. We have had a long discussion in this regard. We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly. His medication options are now limited due to ischemia.  Sotalol is the best option at this time. 

We have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079. If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load. We will assess after his angiogram. We have completed pre procedure blood work, CXR and urinalysis. 

We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

JONES,URIEL   222-67-70-8                    VISIT DATE: 07/19/25

Seen with Dr. Person.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, REVIEW OF 

SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES:  Were reviewed and confirmed.  

Please see Resident note for further details.  

HISTORY:  I interviewed and examined the patient myself.  The 

history briefly is as follows.  This is a 51 year-old male who was 

recently discharged from the hospital here after a successful 

percutaneous lithotripsy and nephrostomy placement.  He presented 

this evening for a leakage from his nephrostomy tube which he 

believes may have become dislodged or had its cap removed when he 

was sitting on the sofa and got up.  He has been leaking 

serosanguineous fluid since earlier today.  He has no fever, 

chills.  No other complaints.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes diabetes, hypertension, CAD, high 

cholesterol.  

MEDICATIONS:  He takes hydrochlorothiazide, Zestril, Calan, Zocor 

and Levaquin.   

ALLERGIES:  He has no allergies to medications.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his family.  

FAMILY HISTORY:  He has no significant family history.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature is 99.2, heart rate 93, 

blood pressure 136/81.  He is an awake and alert male in no acute 

distress.  HEENT - Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.  

Neck is supple.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  

Cardiovascular exam is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub 

or gallop.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Mildly obese.  Skin is 

warm and dry.  Left flank is with some resolving ecchymosis.  No 

obvious subcutaneous fluid, and the area around the nephrostomy 

drain is intact.  His gurney linens are soaked with serosanguineous 

fluid.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  

Neurologically alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  No motor or sensory deficits.   

CONSULTATIONS:  He is seen in consultation by the Urology Service 

and his tubing was cut back and cap replaced.  It is unclear as 

this was placed by Radiology exactly the exact 

configuration of the tubing.  However, it appears to have ceased 

leak at this time.  

DISPOSITION:  He is discharged in satisfactory condition with 

instructions to return for return of symptoms or for any other 

concerns, and to call to have follow up arranged for early next 

week.

EDVISIT^22267708^JONES, URIEL^05/30/31^COOKE, FREDI

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67 year-old male was seen in

transfer from Friends Hospital for evaluation of progressively

worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 days, associated

with increased fatigue and episodes of chest pressure yesterday. 

He did note increase weight for the last 1-2 months,

progressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal

exertion.  He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which

did radiate to his left shoulder.  This seemed to resolve

spontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind

of exertion at all.  The shortness of breath was exclusively

exertional.  He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,

presyncopal symptoms or diarrhea.  No fevers.  He does have a

slight cough that is nonproductive.  He was seen at a local

Emergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as

well as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states

he has some relief of his symptoms associated with this.  He was

cardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his

cardiologist at SAH.  Additionally, at the outside Emergency

Department, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,

but his troponin was elevated at 0.16.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally

controlled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter. 

He has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of

smoking.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and HPI,

otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,

glipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.

ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate

20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.

 HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pleasant, calm.  Neck is

supple.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for

scattered rales in the left lower lung field.  Cardiovascular: 

Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Extremities:  He has

got 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is

symmetric.  Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities

equally.

LABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave

progression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities.  Chest x-ray

shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural

effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild

pulmonary edema.  Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with

creatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.

 BNP is still pending.  INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on

Coumadin.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency

Department, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2

liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic

improvement in his dyspnea.  He has no further episodes of chest

pain or pressure.  I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,

the SAH cardiologist on-call.  I believe this patient has CHF

exacerbation.  He also was recently cardioverted, which ____

explain his troponin elevation.  Additionally, his CHF

exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I

doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.  At this point,

the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on

Coumadin.  We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at

this time.  However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will

be admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for

further evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart

failure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.

DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin

elevation, and diabetes.

DISPOSITION:  Admission in stable condition.

HPI: This is a [AGE] yo F w/a hx of fibromyalgia, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN, bronchiectasis and recurrent PNA who developed severe pain, swelling and stiffness in the MCP joints of both hands 2 nights ago. She says there was initially some redness, no warmth in these joints. She could not open or close her hands. She says the pain migrated to involve all of the joints in her hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. She noticed swelling in her R knee, no swelling or redness in other joints. Her muscles are diffusely tender. She recalls similar muscle discomfort in prior episodes attributed to fibromyalgia, although not as severe. She also remembers shoulder and elbow pain of similar but less intense character in [DATE] while taking rifampin/cipro/azithro for MAC. These symptoms resolved when drugs were stopped. She denies recent fevers or chills. She completed an 8 day course of augmentin for MSSA PNA two days ago. Symptomatically she feels her PNA has resolved and she is at her baseline from a respiratory standpoint w/stable cough and SOB. She does report some mild L-sided pleuritic CP since yesterday. She denies weight loss, skin changes, rash, change in BMs, N/V, dry mouth, change in vision, weakness, paresthesias. ROS + for brittle nails, eye dryness not bothersome.

We will get Chest Films and supplement her home pulmonary regimen with Nebulized albuterol q 4 hrs.  I have encouraged frequent ambulation. She will continue to use her home flutter valve. Her husband provides Chest PT at home and we may order this if appropriate in house.



We will continue her home Inderal at 240 mg qd. This will be supplemented with an ACE I and hydralazine as necessary. The use of an ACE I will be discussed with her PCP as this may have been avoided second to chronic cough. She is not a candidate for Lasix or HCTZ due to her sulfa allergy. Her admission BP of 187/97 was in the setting of a delay in today's dose of inderal. She was asymptomatic with this high pressure. 



We will continue her hormone replacement, GERD prophylaxis with nexium and nightly nortryptiline.  She will be ambulatory and not require DVT prophylaxis.

Uecker, Vastie

MR# 3038560

Date of Admission: 3/30/36

Attending: Dr. Zehr

Admitting Resident: Patricia Nunn

Source of history:  records and pt



ID/CC:	62 yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to PCH w/NSTEMI and DVTs.



HPI: Pt at baseline occasionally gets SOB from her bronchiectasis if she has not had chest PT recently but otherwise is able to walk up multiple flights of stairs without SOB.  She has no known cardiac hx but does have HTN and + fam hx of early CAD.  Pt awoke this morning in her USOH but quickly had sudden onset of 10/10 sharp SSCP radiating to her right arm associated w/ right arm numbness.  Pain is slightly better w/ sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality.  She then had a vasovagal attack, which she has had before in the setting of pain, and she started to feel lightheaded, nauseated, and diaphoretic.  She laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little.  Her husband gave her Excedrin w/o improvement and called 911.  EMS gave her 3 puffs of NTG and 4 baby ASA w/o effect.  The ambulance brought her to the closest hospital, Colorow.  In the ED, she was found to be hypertensive w/ SBP 180s, for which she was started on TNG gtt.  She also underwent PE CT which per report was neg for PE but showed bilat DVTs, and she was started on heparin.  She was given fioricet, zofran, and fentanyl for her CP w/ relief.  She was then given a dose of IV lopressor and also had one episode of N/V.  Her labs were significant for + cardiac markers: 1st set w/ CK/MB/index 39/0.9/2.3, trop I 0.03, 2nd 443/57.3/12.9, trop 2.22, 3rd set 686/87.3/12.7, trop 4.18.  EKGs showed right-bundle morphology (though QRS not wide) w/ initial TWI V1-V3 which progressed to deepening TWI V1-V4 and some downsloping STD V3-V4.  Pt is currently chest pain free, no SOB, no palpitations.  She denies any preceding viral illness or any surprises or acute stressors in her life, though she has many chronic medical problems.

PE CT (reviewed w/ ED rads here): no PE to the level of subsegmental arteries, no dissection, no pericardial effusion or bowing of interventricular septum to suggest RV strain, lung parenchyma w/ scattered nodules, largest 6.5 mm, bilat fem veins w/ filling defects



EKG:  NSR 78 bpm, IVCD w/ right-bundle morphology unchanged w/ TWI V1-V2, flat Ts I, avL, 1 mm downsloping STD V3, < 1 mm horizontal STD V4



TTE: prelim read RV and LV function wnl, no segmental WMA



Impression:   62 yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to PCH w/ NSTEMI and DVTs, now chest pain free.  Possible etiologies for her chest pain w/ + cardiac markers include ACS, PE, myopericarditis, spasm, or apical ballooning syndrome.  Dissection less likely w/ equal pulses and not seen on PE CT.  Her EKG changes suggest an element of RV strain, though this is not borne out on TTE, and review of her OSH CT w/ radiology here did not reveal PEs (at least to the level of subsegmental arteries).  Her TTE did not show WMA, and her story could be c/w ACS or c/w myopericarditis or apical ballooning syndrome (esp w/ hx of fibromyalgia, raynaud   s, migraines, etc), though w/ + cardiac enzymes and dynamic EKG changes, need to have low threshold to cath if develops pain.

Source of history:  records and pt



ID/CC:	[AGE] yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to [HOSPITAL] w/NSTEMI and DVTs.



HPI: Pt at baseline occasionally gets SOB from her bronchiectasis if she has not had chest PT recently but otherwise is able to walk up multiple flights of stairs without SOB.  She has no known cardiac hx but does have HTN and + fam hx of early CAD.  Pt awoke this morning in her USOH but quickly had sudden onset of 10/10 sharp SSCP radiating to her right arm associated w/ right arm numbness.  Pain is slightly better w/ sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality.  She then had a vasovagal attack, which she has had before in the setting of pain, and she started to feel lightheaded, nauseated, and diaphoretic.  She laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little.  Her husband gave her Excedrin w/o improvement and called 911.  EMS gave her 3 puffs of NTG and 4 baby ASA w/o effect.  The ambulance brought her to the closest hospital, [HOSPITAL].  In the ED, she was found to be hypertensive w/ SBP 180s, for which she was started on TNG gtt.  She also underwent PE CT which per report was neg for PE but showed bilat DVTs, and she was started on heparin.  She was given fioricet, zofran, and fentanyl for her CP w/ relief.  She was then given a dose of IV lopressor and also had one episode of N/V.  Her labs were significant for + cardiac markers: 1st set w/ CK/MB/index 39/0.9/2.3, trop I 0.03, 2nd 443/57.3/12.9, trop 2.22, 3rd set 686/87.3/12.7, trop 4.18.  EKGs showed right-bundle morphology (though QRS not wide) w/ initial TWI V1-V3 which progressed to deepening TWI V1-V4 and some downsloping STD V3-V4.  Pt is currently chest pain free, no SOB, no palpitations.  She denies any preceding viral illness or any surprises or acute stressors in her life, though she has many chronic medical problems.

PE CT (reviewed w/ ED rads here): no PE to the level of subsegmental arteries, no dissection, no pericardial effusion or bowing of interventricular septum to suggest RV strain, lung parenchyma w/ scattered nodules, largest 6.5 mm, bilat fem veins w/ filling defects



EKG:  NSR 78 bpm, IVCD w/ right-bundle morphology unchanged w/ TWI V1-V2, flat Ts I, avL, 1 mm downsloping STD V3, < 1 mm horizontal STD V4

Impression:   [AGE] yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to [HOSPITAL] w/ NSTEMI and DVTs, now chest pain free.  Possible etiologies for her chest pain w/ + cardiac markers include ACS, PE, myopericarditis, spasm, or apical ballooning syndrome.  Dissection less likely w/ equal pulses and not seen on PE CT.  Her EKG changes suggest an element of RV strain, though this is not borne out on TTE, and review of her OSH CT w/ radiology here did not reveal PEs (at least to the level of subsegmental arteries).  Her TTE did not show WMA, and her story could be c/w ACS or c/w myopericarditis or apical ballooning syndrome (esp w/ hx of fibromyalgia, raynaud   s, migraines, etc), though w/ + cardiac enzymes and dynamic EKG changes, need to have low threshold to cath if develops pain.

RE:  Francis, Lydia
PAH#:     981-82-02

SUBJECTIVE: Lydia has been doing well since her right total
hip arthroplasty in January of 2089.  She still has pain in
the right hip and the left hip, which is likely due to
osteoarthritis.  She has been taking Percocet for pain
control.  Fortunately, she is not having problems with
constipation, as she is taking a stool softener.  She is
taking calcitonin and Evista for her osteoporosis.  In
addition, she has had a history of right tibial
osteomyelitis and is taking prophylactic Levaquin, without
evidence of GI upset or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  She
is taking Cozaar for her blood pressure control, and is also
taking Neurontin for pain control.  At home, she is wearing
a firm brace that Dr. Younce has prescribed.  In addition,
she is using a walker for ambulation when outside the house
and a cane when inside the house.  She comes today for her
appointment with her son.  She arrived in a wheelchair.

On examination, her blood pressure today is 138/80 with a
pulse of 80 and a respiratory rate of 16.  She is afebrile.
Cardiac exam is a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without
murmurs.  Her neck is supple, although she does have
paracervical pain to palpation.  Her lungs are clear to
auscultation.  She has pain throughout the paraspinal
muscles in the thoracic and lumbosacral area.  She has some
pain with flexion at the hip, with limited motion at both
hips.  She has no evidence of lower extremity erythema or
edema.  Her peripheral pulses are intact.  Her patellar
reflexes are absent.  She has good pedal pulses.  She denies
depression and overall is encouraged.  She plans a trip to
Peru soon.

Medications are updated in LMR.

DISPOSITION: She will follow up with me for a complete
physical examination in November of this year, and she will
be fasting at that time.

Her PMH is notable for HTN, GERD, possible CAD, PVD, possible fibromyalgia with known perforated diverticulitis with abscess, s/p drain in 1/95.  She has been on broad spectrum antibiotics for many weeks. Given her refusal for transfusions and her comorbidities and personal refusal for surgery, she has been treated medically and conservatively.  She was at LRC and was on cefipime, linezolid and oral flagyl for her diverticulitis and was transfererd to PAH ED for ?slurred speech, change in MS, nausea and abdominal pain.  In ED, an abd CT done showed new moderate wall thickening in transverse adn descending colon with diverticular disease. A head CT was unremarkable and according to prior notes in chart, family membes felt her speech is baseline.

imp: 80 year old with HTN, PVD, possible CAD, fibromyalgia with perforated diverticulitis and now worsening colonic thickening on abd CT while on broad spectrum antibiotics.  She has declined surgery in past and again declined surgery yesterday in ED.  Will thus continue current antibiotics, await C diff from stool.  

-check iron levels

-would obtain MRA of mesenteric  vessels to look for mesenteric ischemia (PVD, HTN, CAD, etc).

-hold off on colonoscopy for now given risk for perforation.

-cycle cardiac markers, continue antiHTN and anti-ischemic regimen.

-consult GI and cardiology if clinical conditions worsen.

-check iron levels

-would obtain MRA of mesenteric  vessels to look for mesenteric ischemia (PVD, HTN, CAD, etc).

-hold off on colonoscopy for now given risk for perforation.

-cycle cardiac markers, continue antiHTN and anti-ischemic regimen.

-consult GI and cardiology if clinical conditions worsen.

ADMISSION DATE: 07/01/2095               DISCHARGE DATE: 07/08/2095
     
     
     
     PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest wall pain.
     
     ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: History of diverticulitis abscess, status post
     percutaneous drainage on 01/18/2095 with a colocutaneous fistula;
     hypertension; fibromyalgia; gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal
     motility disorder; history of right tibial osteomyelitis in 2086; history
     of osteoarthritis, status post right and left total hip arthroplasty in
     2088 and 2089; varicose veins with a history of chronic venous
     insufficiency ulcers in the past; status post esophageal dilatation,
     12/2093; atypical chest pain.
     
     PROCEDURES: Surgical consultation with Dr. Yonathan Orth; interventional
     radiation radiology consultation; adenosine sestamibi stress test;
     pulmonary embolus CT of the chest; abdominal CT scan.
     
     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman who is a
     Broadcasting and Performing Arts Manager who had been in the McDonough County Nursing Home until the day
     of admission when she woke up with right-sided and epigastric chest
     discomfort associated with shortness of breath that was associated with a
     feeling of warmth rising from her upper abdomen up to her face.  She
     described no radiation discomfort to her left arm, no diaphoresis.  She has
     had these episodes in the past.  She was noted to be hypertensive at the
     McDonough County Nursing Home, up to 200/130, and was given metoprolol 50 mg and
     multiple sublingual nitroglycerins.  She was sent to Pan American Hospital
     for further evaluation. In the emergency room, she received 3
     nitroglycerins, Tylenol and morphine which helped relieved her pain.
     
     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above, plus ischemic colitis. In
     addition, she is debilitated and has lost a significant amount of weight,
     approximately 40 to 50 pounds since January.  She also has asymptomatic
     gallstones.
     
     MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg daily, Epogen 400 units subcu 3
     times a week, mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime, megestrol acetate 200 mg daily
     until 07/15/2095, Colace 100 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation, zinc 1 p.o.
     daily, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, metoprolol 50
     mg b.i.d., methadone 5 mg b.i.d., isosorbide 20 mg t.i.d., ferrous sulfate
     325 mg p.o., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, lactulose p.r.n. constipation,
     Dulcolax p.r.n. constipation, oxycodone 5 mg q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain.
     
     ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
     
     PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighed 88.7 pounds, pulse 68 and regular,
     respiratory rate 20 and unlabored, room-air oxygen saturation was 97%,
     blood pressure was 160/90.  General appearance: Cachectic, elderly woman
     who was in no acute distress.  HEENT: Mucous membranes were dry, pinpoint
     pupils that were minimally reactive, extraocular motions were intact,
     oropharynx without erythema.  JVP 4 cm supine.  There was no
     lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2.
     There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Chest:
     Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen: There was an IR drain in place in the left
     lower quadrant without external drainage.  The abdomen was soft with mild
     tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant without rebound or
     guarding; bowel sounds are present throughout.  Extremities reveal no
     edema.  There were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis
     on the left side of her foot.  Pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
     
     Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral
     lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength
     in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior
     tibialis.
     
     LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets
     443,000.  INR 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, CPK and troponin were
     negative x3.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia.
     Chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  Her
     adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of EKG or reversible
     perfusion defects.  She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior
     heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%.  CT of chest with a PE
     protocol did not reveal any thrombus.
     
     HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth
     of general surgery.  The patient had expressed an interest in considering
     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.
     Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during
     surgery.  After extensive
     conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,
     I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and
     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may
     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not
     to pursue this.
     
     Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
     Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.  She will
     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.  Her chest wall pain is
     likely due to esophageal spasm.
     
     Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
     
     Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
     fibromyalgia.  This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower
     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications. At the time, we
     will continue pain medications for her comfort.  Continue aggressive bowel
     regimen.
     
     Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to
     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.  The family currently
     working to try to obtain dentures for her.
     
     Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive
     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic
     intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.
     
     DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
     p.r.n., vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, Colace 100
     mg b.i.d., Epogen 4000 units 3 times a week, ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.
     daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily,
     milk of magnesia daily p.r.n. constipation, megestrol acetate suspension
     200 mg p.o. daily to terminate on 07/15/2095, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
     mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. at bedtime, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, oxycodone
     p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, Zocor 20 mg p.o. daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o.
     daily, methadone 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
     
     DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred back to the McDonough County Rehabilitation Center.

Re:	Horn, Gregory

	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23



Dear Dr. Givens:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, in follow-up regarding possible interstitial lung disease. 



He has managed to lose 3 lbs. on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control.



His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees.  They both attribute it to the Prilosec.



He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.  He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.



Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.



No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.



Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.



On examination, he is well appearing.  Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored. Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff. Conjunctivae are clear.  Oropharynx is clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy. Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.  Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.  JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.



Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.



My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.  



Impression:



1.	Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.  Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.  There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.  He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.



2.	GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.  If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.



3.	Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.



4.	Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.



5.	Chronic cough.



6.	Diabetes - Better controlled.



7.	Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.  As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.



Recommendations:



1.	Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d. dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.



2.	Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.



3.	Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.



Sincerely, 





Paul N. Tam, M.D.

He has managed to lose 3 lbs. on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control.



His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees.  They both attribute it to the Prilosec.



He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.  He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.



Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.



No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.



Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.



On examination, he is well appearing.  Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored. Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff. Conjunctivae are clear.  Oropharynx is clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy. Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.  Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.  JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.



Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.



My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.  



Impression:



1.	Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.  Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.  There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.  He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.



2.	GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.  If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.



3.	Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.



4.	Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.



5.	Chronic cough.



6.	Diabetes - Better controlled.



7.	Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.  As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.



Recommendations:



1.	Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d. dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.



2.	Referral to Dr. [DOCTOR] for VATS lung biopsy.



3.	Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.



Sincerely, 





[DOCTOR], M.D.

Re:  	Horn, Gregory

      	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23



Dear Dr. Givens:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, today in follow-up.  



VATS biopsy on 9/27 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading.  



Since the biopsy, he has recovered well, but is mildly more short of breath than previous. For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.



The cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.



He has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.



He has managed to lose 6 lbs. by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.  



GE reflux is very well controlled.



Medications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.



On Examination:  He is well appearing. Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored.  Oropharynx is clear.  Conjunctivae are clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla.  Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis. 



Exercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.



Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.



Weight is 238 lbs. (BMI 38).



Impression:



1.	Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.  I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent.  I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.  



I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.  If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.  The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.  I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs. to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.  Hence, he has his work cut out for him.



2.	Obesity - As above.



3.	Diabetes.



4.	Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.



5.	GE reflux - As mentioned.



6.	Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.



Recommendations:



1.	Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.



2.	Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d. - as 20 mg b.i.d. did not give full control with the generic pills.



3.	We will review pathology.



4.	Follow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.



5.	I strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.  



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.  



Sincerely, 





Paul N. Tam, M.D.

November 20, 2093  Endocrine/Diabetes

Present Illness:  
Asked to see this 59 year old man with IPF, diagnosed in 2090, an admission to BCC last month with pneumonia, who presented with rapidly progressive respiratory distress last week and was admitted intubated to the MICU. He as treated with high dose Solumedrol and with antibiotics, and is improving nicely. He is extubated and has begun to eat. 

Diabetes was diagnosed 14 years ago. He was treated with pioglitazone 45 mg qd, metformin 2000 mg in divided doses and a sulfonylurea until February of this year, when the sulfonylurea was replaced with insulin. For convenience with his travel schedule, his insulin has been 70/30 administered by pen, with 30 U before breakfast and 40 U before  supper. He tests his BS before  breakfast and supper only and reports that, since he has been more careful with his diet recently, they have been in the low 100   s and mid 100   s, respectively. His hemoglobin A1c was 7.4 % a month ago.
Retinopathy:	He is due for his yearly appointment with his ophthalmologist. No retinopathy in the past.  
Nephropathy:	BUN/Cr 31/1.3 today. No microalbumin/creatinine ratio in CAS.
Neuropathy:	He has occasional paresthesias in his feet.
Cardiac:	He is s/p stent for coronary artery disease about 8-9 years ago.
Vascular:	No claudication.

His IPF is treated with Mucomyst and gamma interferon, which he administers to himself. 

Past Medical History:  
Surgery:	Coronary stent
	Lung biopsy at time of diagnosis of IPF 
Medical:	Hypertension	
	Hyperlipidemia
	GERD
Allergies:	No known drug allergies.
Smoking History:	No
Alcohol History:	No

Family History:  
There is a significant family history of diabetes, including his mother, maternal grandmother, one of his 5 siblings, and some paternal relatives as well.

Social History: 
Lives with his wife and their adopted son, who is a Recruitment Officer.
Computer and Network Technicians for General Dynamics, covering 8 states. His job entails travel.

Review of Systems: above
Ears: Mild hearing loss. 
Review of systems is otherwise negative.

Physical Exam:	
Very pleasant, ruddy complexioned man in no distress.
BP:   148/78		P:   76, regular	T: 98.0
Wt:   209 by history		Ht: 5    7.5    by history
HEENT:	Anicteric. Full EOM's. 
Fundi:	Not examined.
Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits
Thyroid:	Not palpable
Chest:	Few rales anteriorly, L>R.
Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  No gallops.  No murmurs
Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 
Extremities:	No edema.  DP 2+ R, absent L. PT 2+,=.  Good foot care.
Neurological:	AJ 1+,=, with normal relaxation. 

Impressions and Plan:	
59 year old man with type 2 diabetes now on steroids for IPF flare, currently down to 125 mg q12h, given at noon and MN.
Having reviewed his recent data, would suggest that we change his current insulin to:
NPH 40 / Regular 10+ scale qAM before  breakfast
Regular 10+ scale qPM before  supper
NPH 30 at bedtime
QID Regular sliding scale
These initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses.
I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone, or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here, as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration.
I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis.
Would change the steroid dosing to 8AM, 8 PM, hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses, PM first, if possible.
He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency. If you agree, would start iron repletion. (Note that in addition to the iron studies, his MCV, though still normal, has come down over time.)

Thanks.

	PULMONARY
	

	BAUER CHIROPRACTIC CLINIC
	


	Interval History:
   Mr. Horn is a 60 y.o. male w/ h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis s/p single right lung transplant in April 2094 whose post-op course has been complicated by CMV viremia, valcyte-induced myelosuppression and severe deconditioning.  Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12/11/94 through 12/30/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection. His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.  Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss. 

During that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.  His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake. Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition. He was discharged without incident on 12/30.

The patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months. He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on 1/29/95.  Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations. He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on 2/14/95 for a WBC of 0.6. At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.  

A repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression; Hct 21.6/Hgb 6.9, WBC 0.4 and PLTs 15K.   Case was discussed with Dr. Valerio and the patient was contacted and instructed to present to the BCC ER for further evaluation and treatment.

	Interval History:
   Mr. [PATIENT] is a [AGE] y.o. male w/ h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis s/p single right lung transplant in [DATE] whose post-op course has been complicated by CMV viremia, valcyte-induced myelosuppression and severe deconditioning.  Mr. [PATIENT] was most recently admitted from [DATE] through [DATE] for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection. His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.  Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss. 

During that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.  His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake. Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition. He was discharged without incident on [DATE].

The patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months. He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on [DATE].  Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations. He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on [DATE] for a WBC of 0.6. At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.  

A repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression; Hct 21.6/Hgb 6.9, WBC 0.4 and PLTs 15K.   Case was discussed with Dr. [DOCTOR] and the patient was contacted and instructed to present to the [HOSPITAL] ER for further evaluation and treatment.  



	Past medical history:
   1. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (pathology consistent with UIP), first
diagnosed in [DATE].
2. Obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Coronary artery disease.

6. UTI (ESBL Klebsiella).
7. C. diff colitis.

RE:Etheridge, Shari

PMH:94482315

 

July 13, 2087

 

REASON FOR VISIT:  Postoperative appointment.

 

HPI:  Shari is an 83-year-old female who on March 21, 2087 underwent an 

ileocecectomy for ischemic bowel.  Two weeks prior to her presentation 

to the Parkview Memorial Hospital she underwent a stent placement to 

her SMA.  After stent placement she was discharged to rehab, and then 

returned to the emergency room complaining of severe sudden onset of 

right lower quadrant pain.  CT scan of the abdomen showed cecal 

thickening with fat stranding locally.  She subsequently was taken to 

the operating room.  Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she 

was discharged to Hendry Hospital where she had remained until May.

 

Her complaints today include some constipation, which she is relating 

to iron intake.  She is going to use some stool softeners and some milk 

of magnesia for this.  She also has some diaphoresis at nighttime, 

which she reports has occurred prior to her hospitalization.  

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, today she denies fever, chills, chest 

pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 

or calf pain.

 

PHYSICAL EXAM: On physical exam she is healthy appearing in no apparent 

distress.  She is accompanied today by her daughter.  Her weight is 164 

pounds.  Her vital signs are 103/80, 70, 16, 96.6.  Her abdomen is 

soft, nontender and nondistended.  Her midline incision is well healed 

with no evidence of hernia.

 

IMPRESSION:  Ischemic cecum.

 

PLAN: Patient was seen today by Dr. Oscar G. Gregory and Quiana N. 

Bullock, NP.  We will send over to her primary care physician the 

operative, pathology, and discharge summaries.  Shari does not need to 

return to clinic unless further surgical issues arise.

CCU JAR Admission Note



Name: Etheridge, Shari 

MR: 2931335

Admitting Cardiologist: Travis

PCP: 



Date of Admission to WGH: January 19th, 2087



ID/CC: 84 year-old woman with CAD, CHF, COPD presents with shortness of breath. 



HPI: (Obtained from patient).  Ms. Etheridge has a history of coronary artery disease, stating that she has a    heart problem.     She is unable to give more details at the present time.  Per old records, she carries the diagnosis of CAD and diastolic heart failure EF 55%.  

	She was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began to complain of    a cold.     She felt chills, even though it was warm in her house.  That day she suffered a mechanical fall, slipping on a blanket in her home.  She hit her left eye, but denies LOC.  The next day, she was    achy    all over, noted a dry cough, and was    wheezy.     The day prior to admission, she states that she    couldn't breath    and had to come into the ER.

On arrival to WGH at 11:30AM 01/18/88 vitals were: P 93  BP 121/82  RR 22  96% on room air.  She had a prolonged ER course of 31 hours duration.  Initially, she was treated for presumed COPD flare with nebulizers, prednisone and doxycycline.  A rapid flu test was positive for influenza A.  She received 1 liter of normal saline.  Approximately 6 hours later, she complained of 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, non-radiating.  EKG showed: sinus tachycardia @115bpm, with STE 1mm AVR, and STD II, V3-V5.  Her pain came to 1/10 with 2L NTG and Ativan.  Small doses of IV lopressor were given.  STDs partially resolved.  Around 10AM the day of admission  (01/19/88) her blood pressure acutely rose to 190 systolics, her heart rate increased to 106bpm.  Per the patient, she remembers having a coughing fit, and being unable to catch her breath.  She was placed on CPAP, then switched to BiPAP for ABG: 125/78/7.13.  She was felt clinically to be in flash pulmonary edema.  She was treated with nebulizers, intravenous TNG, lasix and BiPAP.  With improvement in hemodynamics, her pain and shortness of breath improved.  Enzymes were drawn and showed: trop 0.22, CK 122, MB 11.7.  She was started on heparin, integrillin (though unclear if she received it).

The patient currently denies pain.  She is extremely anxious, refusing blood draws, etc.

3.	Rhythm: Now NSR, reported Afib with RVR in ED.

a.	No EKGs with AF

b.	Tolerated Beta-blocker in ED, can give if necessary for rate control

4.	Shortness of Breath: Likely flu in addition to CHF, COPD.

5.	Altered Mental Status:

a.	Patient became agitated overnight

b.	Per daughter does not have a history of sundowning on prior recent hospitalizations

c.	Rule out CO2 narcosis (based on ED gas), head bleed (recent trauma possible SDH in setting of heparin use), medications, etc

CCU JAR Admission Note



Name: [PATIENT] 

MR: [MEDICALRECORD]

Admitting Cardiologist: [DOCTOR]

PCP: 



Date of Admission to [HOSPITAL]: [DATE]



ID/CC: [AGE] year-old woman with CAD, CHF, COPD presents with shortness of breath. 



HPI: (Obtained from patient).  Ms. [PATIENT] has a history of coronary artery disease, stating that she has a    heart problem.     She is unable to give more details at the present time.  Per old records, she carries the diagnosis of CAD and diastolic heart failure EF 55%.  

	She was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began to complain of    a cold.     She felt chills, even though it was warm in her house.  That day she suffered a mechanical fall, slipping on a blanket in her home.  She hit her left eye, but denies LOC.  The next day, she was    achy    all over, noted a dry cough, and was    wheezy.     The day prior to admission, she states that she    couldn't breath    and had to come into the ER.

On arrival to [HOSPITAL] at 11:30AM [DATE] vitals were: P 93  BP 121/82  RR 22  96% on room air.  She had a prolonged ER course of 31 hours duration.  Initially, she was treated for presumed COPD flare with nebulizers, prednisone and doxycycline.  A rapid flu test was positive for influenza A.  She received 1 liter of normal saline.  Approximately 6 hours later, she complained of 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, non-radiating.  EKG showed: sinus tachycardia @115bpm, with STE 1mm AVR, and STD II, V3-V5.  Her pain came to 1/10 with 2L NTG and Ativan.  Small doses of IV lopressor were given.  STDs partially resolved.  Around 10AM the day of admission  ([DATE]) her blood pressure acutely rose to 190 systolics, her heart rate increased to 106bpm.  Per the patient, she remembers having a coughing fit, and being unable to catch her breath.  She was placed on CPAP, then switched to BiPAP for ABG: 125/78/7.13.  She was felt clinically to be in flash pulmonary edema.  She was treated with nebulizers, intravenous TNG, lasix and BiPAP.  With improvement in hemodynamics, her pain and shortness of breath improved.  Enzymes were drawn and showed: trop 0.22, CK 122, MB 11.7.  She was started on heparin, integrillin (though unclear if she received it).

The patient currently denies pain.  She is extremely anxious, refusing blood draws, etc.

Date of Admission: December 10, 2088

PCP: Quentin Casey 

Attending: Layton, Tyson



ID/CC:	

sob



HPI:   	[Per patient, chart]

85F hx CHF, COPD, DM2, HTN, PVD (s/p mult procedures) p/w acute sob this AM. Pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. Went to WGH Pecos clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. Went back on Tue w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ED pass-off). On Friday AM, woke up with sob. Felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. Sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. Pt denies CP at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived R-sided CP in WGH ED, similar to R-sided CP she has had    off and on for awhile    wh she did not mention to the ED staff). Denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. Denies increase in LE edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. Pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. Pt does think she had similar sob 1-2  yrs ago when she was admitted to WGH, told she had CHF, and was diuresed. Because of her symptoms on Friday 12/09/88, pt went into WGH Pecos clinic. Per Pecos note, EKG at that time showed ST depressions in I,aVL, V5, V6, II/III/aVF. Pt received ASA 325 and lasix 40 mg IV, and was sent to WGH ED.



ED Course: On arrival to WGH ED, pt had VS T 98.2, P 74, BP 160/70, RR 24, O2 Sat 95% RA. Pt's EKG was read as showing ST depressions in V4-V6. Pt received NTG sl x 1, lopressor IV 5 mg x1, lopressor 25 mg po x1, and reportedly EKG changes improved w rate control. CXR in ED was clear. BNP was in 1400s (vs 6000-12000 during prior WGH admissions where CHF was diagnosed).



ROS:   No F/C. Some sweats.  No change in weight/appetite. + dry cough. No wheezing.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena. No delta MS/LOC. No unilateral weakness.

___________________________________________

Impression:

85F w hx CHF, CAD, COPD in w exertional sob that started on AM of admission. Pt has been undergoing treament for persistent UTI. While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD, COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.  CHF is argued against by: normal BNP (especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6000s on prior admission for CHF), clear CXR, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission.  If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes, this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent. However, ST changes appear minimal on close evaluation of EKG changes. Cardiac enzymes are negative so far.



Plan: 

1.	SOB

a.	Cont to cycle cardiac enzymes. Negative so far.

b.	Cont tele

c.	Atrovent and albuterol nebs

d.	Cont home lasix dose for now. Does not appear to be volume overloaded.

e.	Pt has not received stress test which was recommended after most recent WGH admission. Would pursue this now to help sort out whether ? EKG changes are real and indicative of significant ischemic disease. At current level of dyspnea, pt would not be able to do a treadmill test.

f.	PT/OT consults.

HPI:   	[Per patient, chart]

[AGE]F hx CHF, COPD, DM2, HTN, PVD (s/p mult procedures) p/w acute sob this AM. Pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. Went to [HOSPITAL] [CITY] clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. Went back on [DATE] w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ED pass-off). On [DATE] AM, woke up with sob. Felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. Sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. Pt denies CP at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived R-sided CP in [HOSPITAL] ED, similar to R-sided CP she has had    off and on for awhile    wh she did not mention to the ED staff). Denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. Denies increase in LE edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. Pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. Pt does think she had similar sob 1-2  yrs ago when she was admitted to [HOSPITAL], told she had CHF, and was diuresed. Because of her symptoms on [DATE], pt went into [HOSPITAL] [CITY] clinic. Per [CITY] note, EKG at that time showed ST depressions in I,aVL, V5, V6, II/III/aVF. Pt received ASA 325 and lasix 40 mg IV, and was sent to [HOSPITAL] ED.



ED Course: On arrival to [HOSPITAL] ED, pt had VS T 98.2, P 74, BP 160/70, RR 24, O2 Sat 95% RA. Pt's EKG was read as showing ST depressions in V4-V6. Pt received NTG sl x 1, lopressor IV 5 mg x1, lopressor 25 mg po x1, and reportedly EKG changes improved w rate control. CXR in ED was clear. BNP was in 1400s (vs 6000-12000 during prior [HOSPITAL] admissions where CHF was diagnosed).



ROS:   No F/C. Some sweats.  No change in weight/appetite. + dry cough. No wheezing.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena. No delta MS/LOC. No unilateral weakness.

NAME:    Vines, Stephen

MRN:     1672569



Mr. Vines comes in today.  He has been feeling pretty well though he is

distressed at his 18-pound weight gain.  His sugars were in the 300s before starting

the insulin.  Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely.  His

fasting sugars have been in the 120s.  His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s. 

He had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a

month.  Other than that, he really has no new complaints.  He is still not smoking. 

He is still on the patch.  His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he

can stop the Neurontin now.  He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or

edema.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.  No GI symptoms, no GU symptoms and no

new skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints. 



HABITS: Not smoking or drinking.  Not getting much exercise now.



PHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140/80 on the left, 150/80 on the right. 

His pulse is 76 and regular.  Respirations are 16.  Lungs are clear. Heart: Regular

rate and rhythm, negative M/R/G.  No bruits heard.  Nasopharynx unremarkable. 

Abdomen is benign.  He has diminished pulses but good capillary refill in the feet. 

The cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved.  He has some neuropathy of

the feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to

monofilament is intact on both feet. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c today.  It may still be a little bit

     high as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin.  I

     encouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the

     afternoon.  If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning

     insulin to 35 units.  He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his

     neuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry.  He had an eye exam earlier

     this year with Dr. Yousif.



(2)  Hypertension.  Will increase his Mavik to 4 mg a day.



(3)  Hyperlipidemia.  Recheck lipids and SGOT today.



(4)  CAD prevention.  He can't take aspirin so we will start Plavix 75 mg a day.



(5)  Status-post splenectomy.  He needs a Pneumovax booster 0.5 cc was given in

     the left deltoid.

NAME:    Vines, Stephen
MRN:      1672569

Stephen comes in today.  He has been feeling pretty well.  Really has no new
complaints.  He still has 5 block claudication in his calves and he continues to smoke 
a half pack per day.  His neuropathy is stabilized and his sugars have been good for
the most part in the 140-150 range on insulin.  His weight has been stable.  He has
had no shortness of breath or chest pain and his review of systems is otherwise
negative.

HABITS: Smokes about a half pack per day.  Does not drink, not really getting much
exercise.  His legs hurt only when he walks over 5 blocks.  It doesn't hurt when he is
working in the McCormick Company.

PHYSICAL EXAM: He looks well.  His blood pressure is 142/80.  His pulse is 74
and regular.  Respirations are 16. Lungs are clear.  No worrisome skin lesions. No
bruits.  1+ carotids.  Abdomen is soft and nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no
pulsatile masses, no bruits. Decreased pulses in the feet and decreased capillary refill
and decreased sensation of vibration and fine touch.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c to see where we stand.  Continue
     on his current regimen.  Encouraged him to increase his exercise and watch his
     diet.  He has an eye exam scheduled.  His feet look okay, though we will have
     to be careful given his neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.

(2)  Claudication.  Once again, talked to Mr. Vines about the absolute
     importance of quitting smoking.  He is going to try using the Wellbutrin.  Gave
     him a prescription for #60.  He will take one a day for 3-4 days and then go
     up to 1 p.o. b.i.d.  He has no contraindications. I also encouraged him to use
     the patch.  Hopefully, we will be able to get him off the cigarettes.  I also
     encouraged him to walk until it hurts at least 3-4 x a day to try and train his
     legs.

(3)  Hypertension.  Our goal is to get his blood pressure down about 130.  Will
     increase the Mavik to twice a day.

(4)  Hyperlipidemia.  Well controlled on Lipitor.  Recheck his lipids.

(5)  Neuropathy.  Stable.  He doesn't feel the need for any medication for it.

(6)  HPDP.  Will check his guaiac cards.  He is not interested in a sigmoidoscopy. 
     He has had a Pneumovax.  Patient will follow up with me in 3 months.

Reason for visit:

   Angiography for claudication and chronic renal insufficiency



Interval History:

   Mr. Vines is a 70 year old male who has experienced claudication for approximately five to six years.  He describes his claudication as bilateral shin pain which radiates up to his knees.  His symptoms have worsened over the past two to three years and are now limiting his lifestyle.  He is able to walk approximately two to three city blocks when the pain starts and is relieved with rest.  He denies rest symptoms.  He was recently evaluated by Dr. Curtis Cochran for his claudication syjmptoms.  After an extensive conversation and a review of hsi options, Mr. Vines decided to pursue catheter based revascularization.



He underwent adominal aortography and iliofemoral angiography today which demonstrated:

-grossly patent celiac axis, SMA and IMA

-single renal arteries bilaterally with ostial/proximal 65-70% stenosis on the left; the right renal artery has proximal 30% stenosis

-diffuse atherosclerosis of the infrarenal abdominal aorta with 10-20% stenosis

-right common iliac artery diffuse 20-30% stenosis

-right internal iliac artery ostial 70% stenosis

-right external iliac artery patent

-right common femoral artery patent

-right profunda femoris patent

-right SFA with bulky, calcific eccentric 95% stenosis



-left internal iliac ostial 40% stenosis

-left external iliac aratery patent

-left common femoral artery calcific eccentric 70% stenosis

-left profunda femoris patent

-diffuse left SFA 60-70% stenosis in the mid vessel with supraimposed focal 80-90% stenosis

-total occlusion of the left popliteal artery with reconstitution at the TP trunk

-total occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery

-collaterals reconstitute the left peroneal and posterior tibial artery



Mr. Vines underwent dilation of the left femoral artery, dilation of the popliteal occlusion and overlapping Absolute stents to his left SFA.  He arrives to Internal Medicine mildly hypertensive with SBP 140-170s.

HPI:  Patient is a 59-year old who has a history or active issues 
significant for hypertension first diagnosed on visit of 10-74.  She is 
currently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO 
q.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml. equivalents PO q.d.  Patient comes in 
today for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine 
baseline examinations.  On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, 
and on check today it was 150/90.  We discussed the possibility that she 
continue her salt-restricted diet.  We also discussed that she continue 
her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed 
the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.  She currently 
weighs 199 lbs. and stands approximately 4'9"" tall.  
 
As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood 
pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that 
time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine 
XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly 
gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.  However, at 
this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure 
and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood 
pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 
200s-190s.
 
 
Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation 
now appears to be much more stable.  She is currently living with her 
mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good 
about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no 
murmurs.  Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal 
tenderness.  She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace 
swelling bilaterally at the ankles.   Breast exam: no evidence of masses 
or lumps.
 
She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a 
mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool 
guaiacs.  Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent 
issue at this point.

HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a 
diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine 
checkup. Patient appears to be doing fine. She has been compliant with her 
antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also 
hydrochlorothiazide. Since our last meeting, the patient has lost 
approximately 15 to 20 pounds. She has been exercising on a daily basis 
and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and 
beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination 
was 120/80 in both arms. The patient was complaining of some ankle 
swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been 
on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent 
admission. I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which 
I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her 
symptoms over the next few days. 
 
The final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had 
chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065. We 
have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed 
rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises. The 
patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for 
services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain. 
Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming. 
Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.
 
ADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient 
agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have 
either a mammogram or a Pap smear. She complains that she does not have 
faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used 
to and does not want to have done. I attempted to discuss the need and why 
it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do 
this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly 
refuses either of the two examinations.

WESTYN-NUEL,KELLI   898-97-85-6            VISIT DATE: 02/13/79
This patient was seen with Dr. Quilla Uehara, an Emergency 
Medicine resident.  The PRESENTING COMPLAINT, HISTORY OF PRESENTING 
COMPLAINT, PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL 
HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, and REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted on the 
record by Dr. Uehara, and as reviewed with the patient and with Dr. 
Uehara.  Briefly, the patient is a pleasant 64-year-old woman, who 
has had episodes of severe left-sided pressure-like chest pain off 
and on through the course of this week.  This has occurred with 
exertion and has always cleared with rest.  She is pain-free at 
present, but presents to the Emergency Department because she 
reported to her family that she had ceased taking her high blood 
pressure medications. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The physical examination is as noted by Dr. 
Uehara.  Basically, the examination is completely normal with the 
exception of the blood pressure, which ranges from 220 to 230 over 
100 to 110.  The patient's electrocardiogram does not show acute 
changes. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The cardiac troponin I is 0.53. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  I concur with Dr. Uehara that the 
patient has a strong history for unstable angina.  The patient will 
be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation.  She has 
remained pain-free while in the Emergency Department and has 
received nitroglycerin paste.  Her blood pressure will be treated 
with initiation of an ACE inhibitor. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Unstable angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

July 20, 2079
 
Ms. Westyn-Nuel returns following myocardial infarction with
stenting procedure in February of this year. She continues to do
well and had an LDL of 90 in March. We will recheck it again today. 
She has no significant chest discomfort and is doing all of her
activities.  She has no syncope or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
She is tolerating her medications quite well and is happy with her
progress.  At home she takes her blood pressure and it's generally 
around 120/80.
 
Current medications are one aspirin per day as well as Isordil 20
mg. t.i.d., Labetalol 400 mg. t.i.d., Norvasc 7.5 mg. q.d., Lipitor
80 mg. q.d. and Glipizide.  She has not used sublingual
Nitroglycerin although she has this.  
 
Her blood pressure today is 128/80 and her heart rate is 50 and
regular.  Chest is clear. Cardiac exam reveals a II/VI left sternal
border systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is soft and nontender. 
Extremities are free of edema.
 
Ms. Kelli Westyn-Nuel is doing well. We will check her LDL
again today to make sure it did not rebound to a higher level
following her myocardial infarction.  We will also check her liver
function test because of her statin therapy.  We may in the future
need to adjust her nitrates to a more rational once per day
regimen, but her current situation is so stable that we will leave
her medications as is.

New Patient Visit







Chief Complaint of:  2nd opinion



History of Present Illness: 74 yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden. He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.





Impression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH. I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.

INPATIENT CONSULTATION

PATIENT: Ulysses Quin
LMH NUMBER: 9523697
REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Dr. Ziemba 
DATE OF Consultation: 3/08/76

PATIENT ID: Mr. Quin is a 74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 met with pain who is seen for consideration of radiation therapy.
 
HPI:  
Mr. Quin's oncological history begain in 2061 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (unknown gleason, PSA).  He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2061 and salvage XRT in 2062.  His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records.  The patient recalls 37 treatments.   The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 in 10/75.  He underwent a bone scan in 11/75 showing worrisome uptake at L5. In 1/76 he had a PSA of 17.46.  He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control.  His course was complicated by a possible bladder/urethral infection.  He is incontinent from his surgery.  In 2/76 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar/inflammation).  
The patient's LLP worsened.   He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance.  On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed.  The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room. Just before arrival to the ED he developed stridor, in his words he was    sucking air in and out.     ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap, and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening, recommending humidified air by shovel air mask, steroids, and outpatient followup.  MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L4 vertebral body, extending into the pedicles, both L4-5 neural foramina, and the prevertebral soft tissues.  No compression of the thecal sac.

Mr. Quin reports improved pain since admission.  He still has some pain when moving from one position to anther.  he denies fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, LE weakness or paresthesia.  He would like to be cared at the LMH from now on.  The patient had an oncologist from BNH but does not remember his name.

IMPRESSION and PLAN:   
74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 metastasis and pain.  The patient's LBP is likely due to his spine met.  Based on the MRI results, his symptoms and his exam we believe he is an appropriate candidate for palliative radiotherapy to his L-spine.  I discussed with Mr. Quin the likely cause of his pain.  We then discussed the treatment options.  Mr. Quin would like to undergo a course of palliative radiotherapy to relieve his pain.  We will simulate (plan) the patient's XRT tomorrow am, with a treatment to follow on the same day.  All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction.  We would also recommend an GU oncology consultation regarding the patient's ADT and other possible systemic therapies.  The patient only had L-spine MRI, a bone scan may be of benefit to establish the extent of metastatic disease.

Record date: 2076-05-04



Reason for Visit

patient is here to establish primary care

He has metastatic prostate cancer and has completed 12 cycles of radiation to the back with good effect. Last PSA was 1.7.  Is receiving Lupron every 3 months (after his 6 weeks pf Casodex).;





History of Present Illness

Mr. Quin presented in 2061 with a PSA of around 4 and a prostate cancer of unknown clinical grade. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in the BNH system, and disease extended beyond the prostate to the margins of the resection and into the seminal vesicle. In early 2062 he received adjuvant radiation. His PSA remained undetectable throughout the 2060s, but was troubled by a great deal of radiation cystitis with hematuria, frequency, and dysuria. In addition, he was totally incontinent. In 2071 his PSA was undetectably low.   

Over the last 8 months, he has developed low back pain of progressively increasing severity. His PSA back in September 2075 was approximately 3 and when checked in November was 17. Early this year his pain was of great severity, and repeat CT scans and bone scans were performed. Destructive disease was seen in the body of L4 with foraminal encroachment. The thecal sac and the cauda quina were, however, intact. He was started in early February on bicalutamide and was scheduled to have a Zoladex injection, but his pain became more and more severe, and ultimately he was admitted to the LMH last week where I first met him. Since admission he was started on urgent radiotherapy and has completed 12 cycles of radation with a last PSA of 1.7.  He is due for Lupron injection on 6/13/76 at which time a PSA will be checked.

His oncologist Dr. Leblanc has helped him wean the MS Contin and tried to start adding low dose gabapentin as a narcotic sparing agent for presumed neuropathic pain.  He is not requiring his prn pain meds very often.

He has claudication.

He has symmetric leg edema worse right after lupron injection and improved with TEDS.  No chest symptoms.





Problems

      Prostate cancer

Plan as above

      Claudication    : has buttock pain when walking which resolves when stopping.  He has decreased pulses in his DPs bilaterally and has a h/o smoking and diabetes.

      Diabetes mellitus type 2

checks his sugars infrequently.  He is on glyburide 10 am 5 pm.  He had his eyes checked by an opthalmologist recently and no evidence of retinopathy was present. He has no early satiety, blurry vision, polyuria polydipsia, foot ulcers, chest pain, shorteness of breath, but does have some claudication.  He is not on an ACE- inhibitor, takes HCTZ for BP control and has had hematuria from aspirin.



Past Medical History

as above

see CAS note





Family History

see CAS



Social History

See cas



Habits

he has stopped smoking. good social support



Review of Systems

Positives noted in problem list.  Otherwise negative in detail.



Vital Signs

      BLOOD PRESSURE   150/93 

      PULSE   65 

      RESPIRATORY RATE   12 

      WEIGHT   202 lb



Physical Exam

General: Well appearing walking much better with his cane.



Skin: No rashes.



HEENT: NC/AT.  EOMs intact.  PERRL B.  VA OD [] OS [].  Hearing grossly intact.  TMs clear B.  OP clear without exudate.



Neck: Supple, FROM.  No thyromegaly or nodules.  2+ carotids B without bruits.  No LAD.



Chest: CTA B.  No wheeze, rales.



Cor: JVP 4 cm.  Nl S1, S2.  No S3, S4, murmurs.



Abdomen: +BS.  Soft, ND/NT.  No HSM.



Back: No spinous process tenderness or CVAT.





Ext: No cyanosis, clubbing but has mild bilateral ankle edema.

Decreased pulses in DP and PT but good capillary refill

No charcots joints or ulcers in his legs or feet

No cords or calf pain on palpation

 

Stocking glove sensory neuropathy to vibration temperature and proprioception

reflexes are normal





Medications

Glycuride 10am 5 pm

Hctz 12.5 mg po qd

Colace TID

MSCOntin 30 mg am 30 pm with Morphine 15 mg q4h for breakthough but not needing it.

Prilosec 40

Gabapentin Just restarted 100 mg po tid





Disposition and Plans

1. Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain.  I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can.  I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.  His PSA is low and will continue to follow.  If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out

2. Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease. He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past. I will broach this issue next time again

3. DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,. He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton.  Will check lipids.  Will continue to monitor BP.  Will start aspirin when he is willing.

 

Plan to follow up with patient by email

will see in clinic RTC in 3 months

 

Eddie Zajac MD 94212

Seen w/ Dr. Alaniz who agrees with plan.

Since admission he was started on urgent radiotherapy and has completed 12 cycles of radation with a last PSA of 1.7.  He is due for Lupron injection on [DATE] at which time a PSA will be checked.

His oncologist Dr. [DOCTOR] has helped him wean the MS Contin and tried to start adding low dose gabapentin as a narcotic sparing agent for presumed neuropathic pain.  He is not requiring his prn pain meds very often.

He has claudication.

He has symmetric leg edema worse right after lupron injection and improved with TEDS.  No chest symptoms.





Problems

      Prostate cancer

Plan as above

      Claudication    : has buttock pain when walking which resolves when stopping.  He has decreased pulses in his DPs bilaterally and has a h/o smoking and diabetes.

      Diabetes mellitus type 2

checks his sugars infrequently.  He is on glyburide 10 am 5 pm.  He had his eyes checked by an opthalmologist recently and no evidence of retinopathy was present. He has no early satiety, blurry vision, polyuria polydipsia, foot ulcers, chest pain, shorteness of breath, but does have some claudication.  He is not on an ACE- inhibitor, takes HCTZ for BP control and has had hematuria from aspirin.



Past Medical History

as above

Physical Exam

General: Well appearing walking much better with his cane.



Skin: No rashes.



HEENT: NC/AT.  EOMs intact.  PERRL B.  VA OD [] OS [].  Hearing grossly intact.  TMs clear B.  OP clear without exudate.

No cords or calf pain on palpation

 

Stocking glove sensory neuropathy to vibration temperature and proprioception

reflexes are normal





Medications

Glycuride 10am 5 pm

Hctz 12.5 mg po qd

Colace TID

MSCOntin 30 mg am 30 pm with Morphine 15 mg q4h for breakthough but not needing it.

Prilosec 40

Gabapentin Just restarted 100 mg po tid





Disposition and Plans

1. Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain.  I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can.  I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.  His PSA is low and will continue to follow.  If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out

2. Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease. He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past. I will broach this issue next time again

3. DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,. He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton.  Will check lipids.  Will continue to monitor BP.  Will start aspirin when he is willing.

 

Plan to follow up with patient by email

will see in clinic RTC in 3 months

Seen w/ Dr. [DOCTOR] who agrees with plan.

			Assessment and plan:

   It looks like Mr. Quin has had an MI sometime in the past. Myocardial scans showed only mild ischemia in the territory of the prior MI.  Since he is asymptomatic, I would continue medical therapy.  For some reason, he has not started Lipitor.  His LDL is markedly elevated.  My target LDL would be below 70.  For his myocardial protection, I have suggested that he increase the dose of Toprol from 25 mg. qd to 50 mg. qd.

Chief Complaint

urosepsis



History of Present Illness

Mr. Quin is well known to me. He has a severely dysfunctional bladder and severe urethral stricture 2/2 radiation therapy for prostate CA. He has been dependent on a SP tube for bladder drainage, however, after the past 2 SP tube changes, he has developed urosepsis.

Assessment

1. Urosepsis - Treat as you are with Levofloxacin.

2. Bilateral hip pain - given subacute nature of this worsening problem, I would obtain a CT scan of the lower abdomen/pelvis to r/o any drainable fluid collections that we cannot appreciate on PE.

3. Long term plan - I have discussed with Mr. Quin that we are likely headed toward needing a surgical urinary diversion with an ileal conduit. He understands this and is still considering this. We will continue this discussion in outpatient follow up.

Reason for Visit	

Annual physical exam.



Problems	  

breast carcinoma	      

S:  The pt. is five years S/P modified radical mastectomy, with 3 of 14 nodes involved, with a poorly differentiated intra-ductal carcinoma.  She's been on Tamoxifen 10 mg. b.i.d. since that time and is being followed by Dr. Quy Cherry.  For the past several years she has been on 20 mg. of Tamoxifen b.i.d.

O:  Well-healed L modified radical mastectomy.  No axillary notes noted.  R breast appears normal.  Pt. gets routine mammograms on the R breast.

A:  S/P left radical mastectomy for ca. of the breast, with no evidence of recurrence.

P:  No further therapy indicated.

Osteoarthritis	      

S:  Pt. takes Indocin intermittently for pain in her hips and hands.  She has a long history of osteoarthritis.

O:  Minimal degenerative joint disease, changes in hands and legs, with some distortion of the knees.

A:  Mild OA.

P:  Indocin was renewed.

Hypertensive heart disease	      

S:  Pt. has been treated for hypertension since 2064.  When she came to me in 2084 she'd been on Accupril 5 mg. a day, but her BP was 180/80.  Since that time, despite the administration of a variety of antihypertensives, her BP has rarely been normal and she insists that her BP is a function of having come to the doctor.

O:  BP 180/80.  Heart is NSR, without murmurs, gallops, clicks or ectopy.  EKG shows no LVH.  Fundi show some narrowing of the arterioles.

A:  White coat hypertension?

P:  Pt. told that we felt it was important to lower her BP.  She is on Accupril 20 mg. and Atican 32 mg. daily.  She finally accepted our medication to double her medication to Atican 64 and Accupril 40 mg. daily.  We will check her BP in three weeks.



Vital Signs	  

Pulse:	 96   

Weight:	 136   Pounds

Height:	 59   Inches

Blood Pressure:	 180/80   



Physical Exam	  

HEENT	

Bilateral arcus cornealis.  Pupils react = to light.  Fundi show mild narrowing of the arterioles.  Pharynx is clear.  Pt. has upper and lower dentures.  Ears negative.  

Neck	

No adenopathy or thyromegaly.  No bruits.

Breast	

R breast is free of nodules or nodes.  Axillae free of notes.  She has a L modified radical mastectomy with well-healed scar.  

Chest	

Chest is clear to P&A.



Cor/Cardiac	

Heart is NSR, without murmurs, gallops, clicks or ectopy, at 96 per minute.

Abdomen	

No liver, spleen or other organs or masses.  No tenderness or guarding.

She's been on Tamoxifen 10 mg. b.i.d. since that time and is being followed by Dr. [DOCTOR].  For the past several years she has been on 20 mg. of Tamoxifen b.i.d.

O:  Well-healed L modified radical mastectomy.  No axillary notes noted.  R breast appears normal.  Pt. gets routine mammograms on the R breast.

A:  S/P left radical mastectomy for ca. of the breast, with no evidence of recurrence.

P:  No further therapy indicated.

Osteoarthritis	      

S:  Pt. takes Indocin intermittently for pain in her hips and hands.  She has a long history of osteoarthritis.

O:  Minimal degenerative joint disease, changes in hands and legs, with some distortion of the knees.

A:  Mild OA.

P:  Indocin was renewed.

Hypertensive heart disease	      

S:  Pt. has been treated for hypertension since [DATE].  When she came to me in [DATE] she'd been on Accupril 5 mg. a day, but her BP was 180/80.  Since that time, despite the administration of a variety of antihypertensives, her BP has rarely been normal and she insists that her BP is a function of having come to the doctor.

O:  BP 180/80.  Heart is NSR, without murmurs, gallops, clicks or ectopy.  EKG shows no LVH.  Fundi show some narrowing of the arterioles.

A:  White coat hypertension?

P:  Pt. told that we felt it was important to lower her BP.  She is on Accupril 20 mg. and Atican 32 mg. daily.  She finally accepted our medication to double her medication to Atican 64 and Accupril 40 mg. daily.  We will check her BP in three weeks.

Hypertensive heart disease	      

S:  Pt. has been treated for hypertension since 2064.  When she came to me in 2084 she'd been on Accupril 5 mg. a day, but her BP was 180/80.  Since that time, despite the administration of a variety of antihypertensives, her BP has rarely been normal and she insists that her BP is a function of having come to the doctor. In Mar. 2087 she was hospitlaized with acute congestive heart failure and Lasix was added to her regimen that included at that time Norvasc, Atacand and Atenolol.  Despite some peripheral edema, she continues on this regimen and says that she feels well.  She recently celebrated her 81st Birthday surround by her seven children, and multiple grand- and great-grand children. O: BP 170/80; Heart-- NSR wiohtout murmurs or gallopr.  EKG shows no LVH or strain pattern.  A: Systolic Hypertension.  Patient is reluctant to increase or change her meds. P: Continue present meds and will try and increase her medications on her next visit, a month from now.

Osteoarthritis	      

S:  Pt. takes Indocin intermittently for pain in her hips, neck and hands.  She has a long history of osteoarthritis.

O:  Degenerative joint disease, with changes in hands and legs, and some distortion of the knees.  There is swelling of the joints of the hands, particularly both thumbs, but it does not interfere with her life.A: OA.  P:  Will make no changes at this time.

breast carcinoma	      

S:  The pt. is seven years S/P modified Left radical mastectomy, with 3 of 14 nodes involved, with a poorly differentiated intra-ductal carcinoma. She was T2 M1 N0.  She had been on Tamoxifen 10 mg. b.i.d. for 5 years, but this was d/c'd in March 2086 by Dr. Quy Cherry and she has had not sign of recurrence. She does, however, have a great deal of anxiety about the return of her malignancy and when her daughter found a ""lump"" in her back last week in the course of giving her a massage, she became convinced that her cancer had returned.O:  Well-healed L modified radical mastectomy.  No axillary notes noted.  R breast appears normal.  Pt. gets routine mammograms on the R breast. No lumps or masses were found in or on her back. Chest X-ray today shows no nodular densities.A:  S/P left radical mastectomy for ca. of the breast, with no evidence of recurrence. P:  No further therapy indicated, but Alk. Phos. drawn along with routine chemistries.





Review of Systems	

Patient says that she gets short of breath while climbing up stairs, and cannot walk more than a block or two without getting shortness of breath.  She always has edema in both legs, except when she arises in the a.m. at which time her legs are free of edema.  At the same time, she denies PND and says that she sleeps on only one pillow. She denies chest pain, says that she eats well and has regular BMs.  Her biggest complaint now is urinary pressure and urgency.  She had been using a Pessary for Uterine decensus, but it was removed by Gyn and she was prescribed local Estrogen cream, which has not yet helped.  She was advised to call Gyn for another visit, since she was scheduled about 6 weeks from now.

	GRIFFIN NURSING CENTER
	


	Reason for visit:
   Asked by Medicine team to see this 88 yo woman who presents with UGIB 9 d after inferior STEMI/BMS PCI to PLV/RCA


	Interval History:
   Ms. Ulrich is a 88 yo w/ h/o CAD, DM2, and dyslipidemia, who was admitted 10 d ago with an inferior STEMI in the setting of nauseau and CP, who subsequently received BMS stents to the RPLV and mid RCA.  Plavix was reloaded for 1 week in this setting.  She was discharged to a rehab facility in pauls valley 8/10/96 for PT/OT.  At the rehab facility she developed hematemesis and was admitted to the medicine service last night for UGIB.  She denies CP/SOB/N at present.  She does not have memory of the hematemesis episodes overnight.  She required some reorientation to the situation leading to her readmission.


	Past medical history:
   1. CAD:
-s/p PCI of PDA 2089 for 99% lesion in setting of ACS, s/p PCI of 99% LAD lesion in 2090 also in setting of ACS, residual LV function normal w/o focal WMA in 2091.  Inferior STEMI 7/96 due to near occlusion of PLV resulting in BMS to PLV and mid RCA.
2. HTN/Hypertensive heart disease: rather difficult to control HTN, needing multiple agents to achieve near normal to high normal pressures.  Had a good bp response to thiazides but caused unacceptable degree of hyponatremia.  BP also related to the degree of chronic low back pain, and was substantially better for 6 months after localized treatment.  Hypertensive HD manifest primarily as peripheral edema, worsened by norvasc, improved on diuretic.
3. Dyslipidemia
4. DMII
5. Postherpetic neuralgia  
6. Depression  
7. Hemorrhoids  
8. Osteoarthritis  
9. h/o DVT /PE
10. Breast CA  96 T2N1MO ER/PR+ Her2 neg breast CA s/p L radical mastectomy, XRT, and tamoxifen x 10 years  
11. Recurrent UTI  
12. Urinary incontinence 
13. History of HIT AB Positive 2090


	Family history:
   There is a history of non-premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease:  Her father died of a stroke in his 80s, her mother had congestive heart failure, and a brother had an MI.  Her other siblings have lived into their 80s.


	Social history:
   She has not smoked, and uses alcohol only rarely.  She lives at home with her youngest daughter, Vaccaro.  Another daughter, Tiffany, has been also very involved in her mother's care.


	Review of systems:
   As above, otherwise negative in detail. 

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse: 58  
-resp. rate:  16  
-Abdomen:   soft NT and ND, no hepatosplenomegaly, no pulsatile masses.
-Neuro:   a + oriented to self, needs orientation to location and context
-Extremities:   trace lower extremity edema, 1+ bilat PT pulses, 2+ radial pulses
-Chest:   cleart to auscultation anteriorly without crackles or wheezes
-Neck:   JVP not elevated, no HJR, no carotid bruits
-HEENT:   NC/AT, with mild ptosis of left eyelid from post herpetic changes
-General appearance:   A WD, WN elderly woman in no acute distress. Answering questions propriately, but requiring reorientation.
-BP: 155/60  


	EKG:
   NSR, CRO old IMI, NSSTTWAs, no significant change


	Impression:
   88 yo woman with extensive CAD history, HTN and DM2 recently started on oral agents, now presents with UGIB in setting of plavix extended reload of 150 QD x 1 week.

Agree with reducing plavix to 75 QD for now in combination with low dose ASA.  Despite low level cardiac marker elevation there is little suggest an intercurrent coronary syndrome currently complicating the UGIB.  Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 30 days, and preferably for 90 days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents, if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective.  Agree with switching to short term beta blocker, and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion.  Continue high dose statin, ARB, and low dose CCB for BP control.

If UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H2 blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix.  

Will follow with you.

presents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient states he 
developed substernal chest pressure this a.m. at approximately 9 
o'clock, associated with nausea, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, 
and generalized weakness.  He states the discomfort was a 
substernal tightness without radiation.  At the present time he 
states the pain is approximately 4/10 in intensity.  Of note, the 
patient had a stress test done on December 6, 2081, standard Bruce, 
for which he exercised 7 minutes, 30 seconds and stopped secondary 
to fatigue.  He went 74 percent of predicted and developed no 
symptoms.  The test revealed no evidence of ischemia.

platelets 323,000.  CPK was 1213, MB 10.5.  SMA-7 was within normal 
limits.  Cardiac troponin was 0.04.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm 
with nonspecific T-wave changes.  There was a flipped T-wave in 
leads 1 and aVL, which is unchanged compared with prior tracing 
dated December 6, 2081. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated in the 
emergency department with O2, two liters via nasal cannula, 
nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual times three, Lopressor 25 mg p.o.,

ACUTE STROKE CONSULTATION



Called urgently to N-23 for further evaluation of sudden speech difficulty in this 83 yo RH woman who had undergone cardiac cath three and a half hours earlier.  She has remained alert, without somatic motor or sensory complaints, no visual or aural complaints, but some word retrieval difficulty and perhaps slurring of speech.  When first evaluated, she remained alert, oriented to situation, moving all four extremities with fair strength; normal LT. NO dysmetria or ataxia. VF full; {PERRLA; EOMs full s ptosis or nystagmus; no obvious facial or lingual weakness; modulates voice well.  Names; repeats simple test  words, but errs  on 33rd artillery battallion (""33 battallion""); repeats, but elides single words. No R-L confusion, no finger agnosia; no achromatopsia.



NIHSS: 0000000000110= 2 (language/dysarthria)



Taken urgently to CT: no ICH, CTA witrhout obvuious cutoff; taken to MRI



PMH:

She is hospitalized currrently b/o dyspnea, nonSTEMIA, flash pulmonary edema, s/p cath, awaiting CABG b/o triple vessel disease.

Depression          

Hyperlipidemia          

Hypertension          

glucose intolerance          

Gastroesophageal reflux disease     ; EGD shows improvement in her ulcer.     

H/O humerus fracture          left humeral head; comminuted; spring, 2081

benign breast calcifications          9/'80 bx

Basal cell carcinoma          of nose; 7/2084

Osteoporosis          She declines Rx other than Ca/vit. D

Lower GI bleeding          

Colonic polyps    

Osteoarthritis

Never smoked.



ON ASA 81, on iv heparin until cath; iv nitroglycerin currently, metoprolol, captopril, nexium, atorvastatin, MVI and calcium supplements.  NKDA.  



IMPRESSION is of L opercular syndrome- embolic postprocedure.

However, MR-DWI suggests shower of several tiny foci, ditally in cortex anteriorly both on R and L, and old R talamocapsular lacune (possibly related to her 2076 event).



No a lysis candidate. Could resume heparin for her CAD, if indicated.

CODE STATUS : Full code, but would not want continuation of heroic measures if ""there is no reasonable expectation of recovery from physical disability."" LIving Will and Testament in her paper chart. 



Patient is here for follow-up.



1. CAD.  Patient admitted to the hospital in middle of November after she presented with pulmonary edema.  Ruled in for an MI and subsequent cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease and she underwent three vessel CABG.  Postoperative course relatively smooth although she had been postoperative pneumothorax and had a chest tube which was only needed briefly.  Patient did quite well and was discharged to her daughter's home approximately 1 week after her surgery.  Prior to her surgeries there was a brief episode where patient was confused and was having trouble speaking, a neuro consultation was called, a CVA was ruled out and it appeared patient may have had changes secondary to medications.  Has not had any further recurrence of these symptoms.



Since her discharge patient has been doing quite well, no complaints of any chest pain, gets a little bit short of breath after exerting herself for a while but this is secondary to lack of conditioning and comes on gradually and results quickly as she rests.  Has more energy, had previously asked for a walk of a core she felt weak and now does not feel the need for this.  Also had had some lower extremity edema and this has now resolved.  Reports compliance with her new medical regimen with no untoward effects.  She was discharged to home without aspirin.  Patient followed by Dr. Nesbitt and has a follow-up appointment with him end of January, also has follow-up appointment with cardiothoracic surgery.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Patient had a gastric ulcer last July, biopsy without any evidence of malignancy and no evidence of H. pylori.  During recent hospitalization had a follow-up EGD which showed no evidence of continued disease.  Patient does report that for the past two nights she has woken up during the night with some stomach discomfort.  This seemed to have been relieved this morning by Prilosec.  Not using any NSAIDs.



Social History: Living with her daughter for the moment in Culpeper Colorado but hoping to move back to her own apartment in Adrian.



Physical Exam



Patient is in no apparent distress.

Weight: 114 pounds

Blood Pressure: 114/56

Neck: supple without thyroidomegaly, no lymphadenopathy.  Without JVD.

Lungs: Clear.

Cor. S1, S2 without gallops, rubs or murmurs.

Abdomen: non-tender, without organomegaly. 

Extremities: without edema. 



Assessment and Plan



1.  CAD.  Doing quite well, continue current regimen.  Patient to call if any new complaints or problems, recurrence of chest pain.  Will speak with Dr. Nesbitt regarding whether she should restart aspirin q.day, contact patient if recommendation is to restart.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Recent repeat EGD with no evidence of recurrent disease.  Now with some recurrence of epigastric pain.  For the moment she will increase omeprazole to 20 mg b.i.d. and take if this does for several weeks and then go back to previous dose.  If continues to have epigastric pain or needs higher dose of omeprazole will need further investigation.



I will see her for follow-up in two months.





                                                                                                       Osvaldo Lilly, M.D.

Cor. S1, S2 without gallops, rubs or murmurs.

Abdomen: non-tender, without organomegaly. 

Extremities: without edema. 



Assessment and Plan



1.  CAD.  Doing quite well, continue current regimen.  Patient to call if any new complaints or problems, recurrence of chest pain.  Will speak with Dr. [DOCTOR] regarding whether she should restart aspirin q.day, contact patient if recommendation is to restart.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Recent repeat EGD with no evidence of recurrent disease.  Now with some recurrence of epigastric pain.  For the moment she will increase omeprazole to 20 mg b.i.d. and take if this does for several weeks and then go back to previous dose.  If continues to have epigastric pain or needs higher dose of omeprazole will need further investigation.



I will see her for follow-up in two months.





                                                                                                       [DOCTOR], M.D.

PROBLEMS:
1.   Multinodular goiter.
2.   Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.   Diabetic retinopathy.
4.   History of smoking.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Ecotrin, 1 q.d., Synthroid, 0.5 mg. q.d.  Patient has not 
been taking in 3 months after running out of prescription.  Micronaise 5 
mg. q.d.  Premarin 0.625 mg. q.d.
 
HPI:  Mrs. Stephenson returns for her follow-up visit for her diabetes and 
multinodular goiter.  She says that she has no new complaints since the 
last visit.  She denies any episodes of pyuria, dyspnea, weight loss or 
weight gain.  She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain and ankle 
edema.  She has seen her ophthalmologist several months ago and has 
another visit today.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 125/90.  There are no new changes on 
exam.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  Patient's hemoglobin A1c in 2/74 
     was 10.8.  Will recheck hemoglobin on this visit as well as the UA 
          ketones and hemoglobin once she remains elevated on the 
     present dose of Micronase will consider increasing.
 
2.   Multinodular goiter.  Patient's right hemithyroid has unchanged on 
     exam.  She has been off of her Synthroid for 3 months.  We will 
     refill her prescription and reassess her goiter after 6 months of 
     treatment.

     Habitrol patch and has not smoked since.
 
5.   Hypercholesteremia.  Patient had an elevated cholesterol of 319 and 
     triglycerides of 751.  Although these were not fasting levels.  It 
     is suspected the patient will need to have medications to control 
     her hypoglycemia.  Will set her up with the Nutrition department 
     for now for a modified diet.

HPI:  Ms. Stephenson is a 57-year old woman who has a history of multinodular 
goiter status post a hemithyroidectomy 7 years ago, and 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years complicated 
by diabetic retinopathy.  She also has had a TAH and is on Premarin 
replacement.  She has had only one prior visit in Internal Medicine one year ago with 
Dr. Eric Olds, and since then has been seen for med refills by nurse 
practitioners.  She has had no specific complaints, has been relatively 
compliant with her medicines although her understanding of her disease 
process appears to be limited.  She currently is taking Micronase 10 mg. a 
day, an aspirin a day, and Premarin .625 mg. a day.  She describes 
intermittent symptoms of hyperglycemia, although she follows her blood 
sugars with urine dipsticks and says that they have been running in the 
non-detected range most often.  She has not had any new visual blurring, 
excessive polydipsia or polyuria.  She has not been taking her Synthroid 
medication for the past year since she last saw Dr. Olds, since she ran out 
of the medication.  She has made no effort to get a refill on this, and 
has not noticed any significant difference.  She denies excessive fatigue, 
palpitations, constipation, or lethargy, yet she inquires today about 
potentially restarting this medicine.  She has no other specific 
complaints.  She has a good energy level.
 
Social History:  She works at Nvidia and lives with her son.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Habits:  She does not drink.  She had quit smoking a year ago, but has 
been smoking this past week due to some stresses at home, and is planning 
on stopping this.
 
Physical Exam:  Blood pressure 148/83.  Pulse 70 and regular.  HEENT exam 
reveals a palpable right thyroid lobe and an absent left thyroid lobe 
without specific nodularity or tenderness.  She has no adenopathy.  Her 
oropharynx is clear.  Her chest is clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam:  
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs or rubs.  Her abdomen is 
obese, soft and non-tender.  She has abnormal pigmentation across her 
skin, including her palms and her soles of her feet, and no peripheral 
edema.
 
Assessment/Plan:
 
1)   Diabetes mellitus.  Will continue on Micronase 10 mg. a day, check a 
     hemoglobin A1C, and send her to the eye doctor.  We have talked about 
     good foot hygiene, and she will continue to check her urine 
     dipsticks.  
 
2)   History of multinodular goiter. I will send a TSH today to assess her

Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
was positive.  She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.  She had 1mm 
and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
disease.  She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
vigorously, which is rapidly walking.  She vehemently denies that she 
has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
 
We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
 
PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.  She 
refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
for taking it.  She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
on atenolol.  
 
Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.  
 
We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.  I will continue to work 
with her strenuously on risk factor modification.  Her other risk 
factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.  Her 
diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
 
She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
hospital.

I saw this patient on 07/15/2086 in conjunction with Dr. Echols. 

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 68-year-old female with leg pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known coronary

artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes, status

post left fem-pop bypass and transmetatarsal amputation of her

left foot at the Siouxland on 05/02/2086.  This was complicated by

acute renal failure with creatinine between 1.6 and 2.4 and

labile sugars.  She was discharged to rehab on 04/19/2086 for

approximately 1 month.  Subsequently, she developed left thigh

erythema, swelling, and pain along the incision site yesterday. 

She has had no fevers, nausea, or vomiting but has had difficulty

ambulating due to pain, denies any diarrhea but has had some mild

stomach upset.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable as I said for hypertension,

diabetes, CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism.  She had MIBI in 2084 with LAD and

D1 lesion.  Her EF was 35%.  She had a CABG in 2083.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, atenolol, aspirin,

hydrochlorothiazide, insulin, Lasix, lisinopril, Norvasc,

Synthroid, Zocor, and Zoloft.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in no

acute distress, however, distinctly uncomfortable.  Vital signs: 

Temperature is 97.2, pulse 59, respiratory rate 20, blood

pressure 148/67, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  For

full physical exam findings, please see the resident's written

note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, abdominal exam, and neurologic

exams are within normal limits as documented.  Respiratory exam

reveals crackles at the bases but no respiratory distress. 

Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic

ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. 

Musculoskeletal exam:  The fem-pop incision on the left leg is

concerning for purulent drainage along the incision site,

especially along the upper aspect of the upper thigh.  There is

approximately an area of 8 x 5 cm of erythema, induration, and

tenderness surrounding the area draining purulent material.  The

patient also has a transmetatarsal amputation.  The wound there

is clean, dry, and intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood

count of 10.9, BUN and creatinine ratio of 30:1.4 respectively.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Surgery was consulted regarding

this likely wound infection.  Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and

Flagyl were their request for antibiotics.  These were

administered in the Emergency Department, and the patient will be

admitted for likely operative debridement of this wound

infection.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Postsurgical infection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Diabetes.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Peripheral vascular disease.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted.

Mr. Fredrick is a 48-year-old man status post right middle lobectomy on September 24, 2096, for T1N0 carcinoid.  He has had no complaints, since that time, and denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He has gained several pounds, but is otherwise feeling well.

On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  He has no palpable cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy.  His blood pressure today is 130/88, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 89.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits; and there is no murmur, rub or gallop.  His resting O2 saturation is 100% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 20 per minute.  His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 232 pounds.  His chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, with good excursion and no change in tactile fremitus or egophony between the two hemithoraces.  Abdominal examination is benign.  I cannot appreciate any hepatosplenomegaly, and no other masses are identified.  He has no tenderness to palpation.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His incisions are well-healed, and no nodules are appreciated.  

The chest x-ray today is unchanged, with no evidence of new nodules, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  His recent chest CT scan shows several stable parenchymal nodules and no evidence of recurrent lymphoma or carcinoid.

In summary, I am pleased to find Mr. Fredrick well, without evidence of recurrence.  The plan is to see him for follow-up in four months.

Mr. Fredrick returns to clinic three years following right middle lobectomy for T1N0 carcinoid.  He is a 50-year-old man without symptomatic complaints.  He denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He had a recent chest CT scan which was of concern to him.

On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  No supraclavicular, cervical or axillary adenopathy is noted.  His blood pressure today is 132/92, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 86.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits; there is no murmur, rub or gallop.  His resting O2 saturation is 98% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 16 per minute.  His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 228 pounds.  Chest examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally to percussion and auscultatory examination.  He has good chest wall excursion and no evidence of wheezing.  He does not have any egophony.  His abdomen is soft, nondistended and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly; and his extremities show no evidence of edema, cyanosis or clubbing.  The surgical wound is well-healed.  There is no evidence of local recurrence.

The chest CT scan shows two small nodules that do not appear to have significantly changed given the correction for volume averaging. The area of his previous resection shows no suggestion of recurrence.

In summary, Mr. Fredrick has two small pulmonary abnormalities that are not particularly suggestive of recurrent disease.  I agree with Dr. Ordonez's plan to repeat the CT scan in four months.

SDU ADMIT DATE:  01/17/05

REASON FOR SDU ADMIT:  NSTEMI;  Awaiting cardiac catheterization

CC:  55 y.o. male w/ DM type 2, hyperlipidemia, positive family history for CAD, and hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who p/w NSTEMI



HPI:  

Mr. Fredrick is a pleasant 55 y.o. male with cardiac risk factors of recently diagnosed DM Type 2 (NIDDM), hyperlipidemia, and extensive family history, as well as, hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who presents with chest pain, and found to have NSTEMI at Modesto State Hospital (MSH), transferred to SSH for cardiac catheterization.  Patient woke up on 1/16/05 with intermittent, stuttering ""pressure-like"" substernal chest pain, rating 7 out of 10, lasting from 15 minutes to 45 minutes.  He is very active with walking exercises, and gardening, and had not experienced this type of pain before.  The pain radiated down the left arm, his left jaw, and shoulder, as well as, causing ""throat tightness"".  He denied associated SOB, DOE, diaphoresis, palpitations, fevers, chills, N/V/D, or any other constitutional symptoms.  He took an ASA 81mg PO x1, called his PCP, and presented to MSH.



In the MSH ED, his vitals were as follows:

T: AF   HR: 109   BP: 169/81   FS: 248

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 104bpm with ST depressions in V3-V5.  He received morphine 2 mg IV, ASA 325 mg, SL TNG x 2, Lopressor IV 5 mg x 3.  The chest pain resolved, and the pt has been chest pain free since.  6 hours after presentation he had 7 beat run of VT. He has not had anymore chest pain since the ER but did have palpitations with VT run. He feels his heart being 'irregular' at times.  He was started on IV heparin and an IV 2b/3a inhibitor, and transferred to SSH on 1/17/05 for cardiac catheterization. 



PMH/PSH

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Chest pain



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Dr. Fredrick Debra is a 59 yo with CAD, HTN, and DM2 who presents with three days of chest discomfort and hypertension.  His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard.  He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset.  It does not radiate.  It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved.  It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting.  He has not had any recent URI symptoms.  Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort.  He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190/102 averaging 170/80.  He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes.  He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1/4 mile today.  He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema.  His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.  



He called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID.  He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below).  On arrival, the vital signs were T 96.7, P 71, BP 166/81, RR 18, Sat 97% RA.  He had negative kiosk biomarkers and no EKG changes.  He received NTG x3 without much relief and ASA at home.

This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and 
obesity.  Her problems are as follows:
 
1.   Diabetes.  She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
     and she was put on insulin by me.  Xitlali Xia followed her in 
     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.  
     She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
     list of her blood sugars.  She says she does take them about twice a 
     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
     threw them away.  She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
     they usually are about 110.  It was 101 this morning before 
     breakfast, she says.  She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
     six times it has been below 50.  She does say she eats three regular 
     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
     breakfast she said no.  She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
 
     I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.  I expressed to her again how 
     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  
     She had been eating a lot of chocolate.  She says she has gotten off 
     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
     then.  She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
     help her with her diet.  If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.  I explained to her, too, 
     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
     be able to get her off the insulin.  This seemed to be something that 
     she would like to do.  Hopefully the nutritionist can help.  I also 
     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
     really going on and whether they are getting too low.  She denies any 
     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  I am 
     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.  
     She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
     nothing.  She felt totally normal.  So hopefully she will really 
     record these and we will get a better idea.  She said this always 
     happens in the morning.  She kept contradicting herself and had no 
     documentation.  I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
     Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  She does drink juice, 
     but I went over the symptoms again with her.  She will call me if she 
     does have any.
                                              10-19-86
 
 
 
2.   Left ankle pain.  I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.  
     She said that she may do some surgery on her.
 
3.   Dysuria.  She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
     Bactrim.
 
4.   Yeast infection.  She said this has also resolved.
 
5.   She complains of headache.  She says these have been going on for two 
     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.  
     She has had nausea and vomited once.  This happened pretty much every 
     day and it can be at any time of the day.  Tylenol and Advil did not 
     help.  She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.  
     But she has no further prodrome.  She says it is a banging kind of 
     pain that is rhythmic.  She also says she does see stars in front of 
     her eyes when it happens.  I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
     sometimes.  It has been happening for a couple of weeks.  I discussed 
     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
     migraines.  I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  Her neuro exam 
     was totally normal.  Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.  
     Her gait was normal.  Light touch was touched.  Her toes were 
     downgoing.  Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  Her disks were 
     sharp.  EOMI, PERRL.  I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
     t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
     her left ear.  I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
 
6.   Health maintenance.  I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
     that she might benefit from a flu shot.  She has no interest in this 
     at all.  Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
     cuff.  Her pulse was 96.  Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
     285.

This patient was seen with Dr. [DOCTOR].
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [AGE] year old woman with diabetes and 
obesity.  Her problems are as follows:
 
1.   Diabetes.  She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
     and she was put on insulin by me.  [DOCTOR] followed her in 
     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.  
     She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
     list of her blood sugars.  She says she does take them about twice a 
     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
     threw them away.  She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
     they usually are about 110.  It was 101 this morning before 
     breakfast, she says.  She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
     six times it has been below 50.  She does say she eats three regular 
     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
     breakfast she said no.  She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
 
     I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.  I expressed to her again how 
     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  
     She had been eating a lot of chocolate.  She says she has gotten off 
     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
     then.  She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
     help her with her diet.  If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.  I explained to her, too, 
     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
     be able to get her off the insulin.  This seemed to be something that 
     she would like to do.  Hopefully the nutritionist can help.  I also 
     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
     really going on and whether they are getting too low.  She denies any 
     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  I am 
     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.  
     She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
     nothing.  She felt totally normal.  So hopefully she will really 
     record these and we will get a better idea.  She said this always 
     happens in the morning.  She kept contradicting herself and had no 
     documentation.  I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
     Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  She does drink juice, 
     but I went over the symptoms again with her.  She will call me if she 
     does have any.
                                              [DATE]
 
 
 
2.   Left ankle pain.  I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.  
     She said that she may do some surgery on her.
 
3.   Dysuria.  She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
     Bactrim.
 
4.   Yeast infection.  She said this has also resolved.
 
5.   She complains of headache.  She says these have been going on for two 
     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.  
     She has had nausea and vomited once.  This happened pretty much every 
     day and it can be at any time of the day.  Tylenol and Advil did not 
     help.  She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.  
     But she has no further prodrome.  She says it is a banging kind of 
     pain that is rhythmic.  She also says she does see stars in front of 
     her eyes when it happens.  I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
     sometimes.  It has been happening for a couple of weeks.  I discussed 
     this with Dr. [DOCTOR] and we both agreed that these do sound like 
     migraines.  I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  Her neuro exam 
     was totally normal.  Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.  
     Her gait was normal.  Light touch was touched.  Her toes were 
     downgoing.  Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  Her disks were 
     sharp.  EOMI, PERRL.  I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
     t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
     her left ear.  I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
 
6.   Health maintenance.  I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
     that she might benefit from a flu shot.  She has no interest in this 
     at all.  Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh

     285.

HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 30-year-old woman with diabetes who comes in for a 
regular follow-up.
 
Assessment and Plan:
1.   Diabetes.  She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, 
     has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been 
     ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below.  This is 
     borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9.  She 
     definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight 
     is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87.  She had a recent hemoglobin A1C 
     and urine dip.  She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one 
     for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her.  She also needs 
     to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go.
 
2.   Health maintenance.  Patient does not want a flu shot.  Otherwise, 
     she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter 
     with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit.  
     We will do so.
 
3.   Migraine headaches.  She said she has had one every day recently.  
     This is worse than her usual.  The Motrin was not helping.  I 
     therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to 
     use.  Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do.  
     I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better.
 
4.   Ankle pain.  Patient has chronic ankle pain.  She went to an 
     Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it 
     got better.  She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement 
     and would like to go back to the Orthopedist.  I therefore referred 
     her at her request.

                                              9-14-88
 
 
 
HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 31 year old woman with a history of morbid obesity, 
complicated by diabetes, who was a former patient of Dr. Xitlali Crane.  
She comes in today for routine follow-up.  Patient's diabetes was 
initially diagnosed during gestation with her daughter.  Patient was 
formerly controlled by insulin but has lost 61 pounds over the last 16 
months and is now off all medications and states her finger sticks have 
been excellent with a peak of about 150, with most well below that.  
Patient also has a history of        in situ which was treated with laser 
treatment to the cervix.  She is a hemophiliac carrier.  Has a history of 
migraines and currently is being treated by Dr. Jacoby for depression.  
Since her last visit with Dr. Crane, patient apparently attempted suicide 
in July.  It is unclear how serious the attempt was although she did cut 
her left upper extremity.  Since then she states that she has been feeling 
a lot better and feels that she has really made progress with Dr. Jacoby.  
Her mood seems fine today in clinic.  Patient denies any medical symptoms 
at this time.
 
Patient's cardiac risk factors include smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day.  A 
positive family history of coronary artery disease including a mother who 
just died of a heart attack in May at age 53 and had had a previous MI at 
age 40 and a CABG at age 43.  Patient does not have hypercholesterolemia 
or hypertension but does have the diabetes history as noted above.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Notable for tobacco use as noted above and she drinks 
about one beer per day when she is distraught that she continues to do.  
She says that she should not be drinking with her medications.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Moderately obese Hispanic woman in no acute distress.  
Blood pressure: 120/70.  HEENT: unremarkable.  Neck: no JVD, carotids were 
2+ bilaterally without bruits.  Chest: clear.  Cardiac: within normal 
limits.  Abdomen: benign.  Extremities: without edema.
 
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
1.   Weight control:  Patient has had excellent weight loss over the last 
     16 months.  I told her how impressed I was with this.  She, in fact, 
     does not require any oral hypoglycemics for good sugar control at 
     this time.  I will let her continue this dietary control for the next 
     six months and check her hemoglobin A1C at that time to assess her 
     control.  However, in the past, she has been very straight forward 
     with Dr. Crane according to her notes.
2.   Depression:  Patient continues to be actively depressed.  Is 
     currently on trazodone, Klonopin, Paxil and Motrin.  She will 
     continue to follow-up with Dr. Jacoby with whom she seems to be very 
     happy.

3.   General health care:  Patient will need a pelvic exam in six months 
     time.  Patient currently has an intrauterine device which was placed 
     in June.  She does not take oral contraceptives because of her 
     history of diabetes and history of heart disease.  She was instructed 
     that she should go to Gynecological Clinic if any symptoms related to 
     the IUD occur.
4.   Diabetes:  Patient's blood sugars have had peaks of about 150 as 
     mentioned above.  I will check her hemoglobin A1C in six months time.  
     Patient feels good with no polydipsia, no urinary frequency and no 
     headache.  I elected, therefore, not to treat it at this time.  
     Patient was given prescriptions for fingersticks and lancets.

                                              11-30-93 



IDENTIFICATION:  Ms. Youngman is a 36 year old woman with the following 
medical problems: 

1.   Type II diabetes mellitus.
2.   CAD.
3.   History of CIN2 status post laser treatment to the cervix.
4.   Depression.
5.   History of substance abuse.
6.   GERD.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d., atenolol 
25mg PO q.d., glyburide 5mg PO q.d., Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s., Celexa 20mg 
PO q.d., Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s., Prevacid 30mg PO q.d., trazodone 150mg 
PO q.h.s.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
depression.  Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s. Zantac and scheduled for a 
upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
study.  She is scheduled later this month.  She has no new complaints, 
although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
it over the past two days.  She denies any increasing polyuria, 
polydipsia, polyphagia.  Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
the morning.  I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
that she has been taking them.  It is not entirely clear to me whether 
this is true or not.  

Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.  She says 
she is feeling a little bit better.  She was recently started on 
risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
a month.  She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.  She says overall 
she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.  We again discussed the 
importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.  

Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
frequency.  She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
rest.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.  Her 
pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.  Her weight today is 
249lb.  Her sclera are nonicteric.  Her JVP is not visible at 90 
degrees.  There are no carotid bruits.  Her lungs are clear to 
auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
positive S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Her 
extremities are warm and without significant edema.  Her finger stick 
blood sugar in the office today was 331.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.

1.   Diabetes.  Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
     essentially unchanged from six months prior.  Finger stick in the 
     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
     over the past couple of months.  In any event, she most likely need 
     a higher dose of sulphonurea.  We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.  
     Her last urine microalbumin was negative.

2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  When she returns to clinic in three months, 
     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
     Lipitor for approximately six months.

3.   Coronary disease.  She is still having exertional chest pain.  
     Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d. as she did have room to go 
     with her pulse and blood pressure.

4.   Depression.  I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
     her psychiatrist and her counselor.  Again, reinforced the 
     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
     again as I have in the past.

5.   GERD.  She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
     PPI and H2 blocker for now.  I told her she should take the 
     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.

IDENTIFICATION:  Ms. [PATIENT] is a [AGE] year old woman with the following 
medical problems: 

1.   Type II diabetes mellitus.
2.   CAD.
3.   History of CIN2 status post laser treatment to the cervix.
4.   Depression.
5.   History of substance abuse.
6.   GERD.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d., atenolol 
25mg PO q.d., glyburide 5mg PO q.d., Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s., Celexa 20mg 
PO q.d., Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s., Prevacid 30mg PO q.d., trazodone 150mg 
PO q.h.s.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [PATIENT] returns to clinic today to 
follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
depression.  Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s. Zantac and scheduled for a 
upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
study.  She is scheduled later this month.  She has no new complaints, 
although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
it over the past two days.  She denies any increasing polyuria, 
polydipsia, polyphagia.  Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
the morning.  I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
that she has been taking them.  It is not entirely clear to me whether 
this is true or not.  

Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.  She says 
she is feeling a little bit better.  She was recently started on 
risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
the [HOSPITAL] by the name of Dr. [DOCTOR] whom she sees once 
a month.  She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.  She says overall 
she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.  We again discussed the 
importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.  

Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
frequency.  She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
rest.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.  Her 
pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.  Her weight today is 
249lb.  Her sclera are nonicteric.  Her JVP is not visible at 90 
degrees.  There are no carotid bruits.  Her lungs are clear to 
auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
positive S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Her 
extremities are warm and without significant edema.  Her finger stick 
blood sugar in the office today was 331.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  [AGE] year old woman with multiple medical 
problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.

1.   Diabetes.  Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
     essentially unchanged from six months prior.  Finger stick in the 
     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
     over the past couple of months.  In any event, she most likely need 
     a higher dose of sulphonurea.  We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.  
     Her last urine microalbumin was negative.

2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  When she returns to clinic in three months, 
     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
     Lipitor for approximately six months.

3.   Coronary disease.  She is still having exertional chest pain.  
     Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d. as she did have room to go 
     with her pulse and blood pressure.

4.   Depression.  I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
     her psychiatrist and her counselor.  Again, reinforced the 
     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
     again as I have in the past.

5.   GERD.  She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
     PPI and H2 blocker for now.  I told her she should take the 
     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.

6.   Health maintenance.  She received a flu shot and she will return to 
     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.  Additionally, I 
     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.  I also stressed the

11/24/94





PROBLEMS:  Ms. Youngman is a 37-year-old woman with the following 

medical problems:

1.	Diabetes.

2.	History of polysubstance abuse.

3.	Recent bilateral pyelonephritis.

4.	History of CIN 2 and laser to cervix.

5.	Depression.

6.	CAD with ischemia on MIBI in October 2093.

7.	Gallstones.

8.	Status post appendectomy in July 2093.

9.	GERD.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include glyburide 15 mg p.o. q.d., Prevacid 

30 mg p.o. q.d., atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. 

q.d., enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Celexa 20 mg p.o. 

q.d., and trazodone 150 mg p.o. q.h.s.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today 

for follow up regarding her diabetes.  Since I last saw her, she 

has been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid 

October.  Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a 

repeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were 

essentially within normal limits.  She denies any recurrent flank 

pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.  Says overall she is feeling 

relatively well.  She is taking all of her medications as 

prescribed.  She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, 

fatigue, or blurry vision.  She continues to smoke.  She has not 

been exercising.  She also continues to have intermittent chest 

pain of unclear etiology.  Several days ago, she had an episode 

that lasted a minute or two at rest.  She described it as a 

tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, 

nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.  She has 

no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional 

symptoms in the past few days.  She has not been taking her blood 

sugars at home as her machine is broken.  Also, she self-

discontinued her lisinopril.  She thought it gave her a headache.







Youngman, Codi

Page 2





PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no 

distress.  Pulse 68 and regular.  Blood pressure 134/84 and 

weight 226.  Fingerstick today 198.  Neck veins are non-elevated.  

No carotid bruits.  Oropharynx is clear.  Lungs are clear to 

auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.  

Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Extremities are warm and without 

edema.  Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to 

vibration and light touch.



LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 

normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-

waves.  Hematocrit and troponin are pending.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 

problems as follows:

1.	Type 2 diabetes.  Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 

the 9.0.  She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 

try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.  At this point, it 

is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 

regimen starting with b.i.d. NPH, and we will refer her to the 

diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 

with a plan to transition her at that time.  Her urine 

microalbumin was negative a few months ago.  We will recheck 

her hemoglobin A1c today.  She has been to the ophthalmologist 

recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.

2.	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 

pain is somewhat concerning.  She does have coronary disease 

as per her MIBI just over a year ago.  She is taking an 

aspirin and a beta-blocker.  Her EKG today is normal, and she 

has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 

exertion.  Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 

pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 

the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 

and beta-blocker.  I will repeat her stress test to see if her 

ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 

referring her to Cardiology.

3.	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 

prefer better blood pressure control.  She agreed to try the 

lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 

thinks it disagrees with her.  I told her I felt the headache 

was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.

4.	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 

I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 

today without receiving one.  

5.	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

MS III Admission Note

Patient:  Eubanks, Larry
MRN:  7744323
DOB:    10/03/2080
Admit Date:  01/10/49
PCP:  Talbert, Nicholas	(783)508-2821
Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital

CC:  chest pain

HPI:
Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.  

In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.  He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.  Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.  The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.  On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.  Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.  A subsequent exercise echo was normal.  Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.  His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.  Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.   He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.  

Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.  These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.  The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.  His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.  He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.  Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.  The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.  

Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.  The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.  

In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.  EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.  Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.  CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.

Assessment:

Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.  The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.  The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.  The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.  The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.  In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.  The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.  Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.  This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.  
EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.   The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.  The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.  The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.  Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.  


Plan:  

1.  Chest pain
Telemetry, cardiac monitor
Troponin, CK, CK-MB q8h x 3
LDH on next draw
EKG if chest pain reemerges or in AM if no chest pain flare
ASA 325 mg po qd

Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student. In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms. He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time. The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin. Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week. He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema. He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital. He does not know the details of the workup. Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65. He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose. 
In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro. HR was 85 and BP 135/82. He was given ASA and a BB. Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6. Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6. There were no old EKGs available for comparison. He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44). A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE. (the ddimer was elevated). His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation. On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free. Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema. ASA and BB were cont. The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test. However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead. This is planned for this morning. Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

Admit Date:  [DATE]
PCP:  [DOCTOR]	[PHONE]
Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from [HOSPITAL]

CC:  chest pain

HPI:
Mr. [PATIENT] is a [AGE] year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.  

In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. [PATIENT]    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early [DATE].  He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.  Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.  The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.  On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.  Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.  A subsequent exercise echo was normal.  Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.  His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in [DATE].  Hemoglobin A1C in [DATE] was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.   He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in [DATE] for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.  

Mr. [PATIENT] was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.  These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.  The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.  His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.  He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.  Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.  The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to [HOSPITAL] ED from his [CITY] home.  

Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.  The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.  

In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.  EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.  Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.  CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.  Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.  Stool sample was guiac positive, although CBC was stable with HCT 44.6.

	Reason for visit:

   Mr. Eubanks is a 68 yo man w/ recently diagnosed CAD s/p LAD stent.



	Interval History:

   Mr Eubanks presents for hospital followup after presenting to BBH in January 2149 w/ after he developed 2 episodes of chest pain lasting 1-2 minutes each and not associated with any symptoms.  On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back.  Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care. In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved. EKGs showed biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology.  Cardiac markers were negative.  Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management. Of note, at Pennsylvania Hospital, patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in 2/47, followed up with normal exercise echo in 5/47.



On first night of admission, patient developed recurrent chest pain when going to the bathroom.  Because of his risk factors for disease, the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit.  He received 3xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation.  RCA with moderate disease.  LCx with distal disease.  

Patient was transferred to the SDU for further care.He was started on beta-blockers and ace-inhibition, and tolerated these medications well.  He was evaluated for cardiac rehab. Of note, patient was informed of the pulmonary nodule located on CT scan and the need for follow-up CT in 3 months.

	Reason for visit:

   Mr. [PATIENT] is a [AGE] yo man w/ recently diagnosed CAD s/p LAD stent.



	Interval History:

   Mr [PATIENT] presents for hospital followup after presenting to [HOSPITAL] in [DATE] w/ after he developed 2 episodes of chest pain lasting 1-2 minutes each and not associated with any symptoms.  On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back.  Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the [HOSPITAL] ED for further care. In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved. EKGs showed biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology.  Cardiac markers were negative.  Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management. Of note, at [HOSPITAL], patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in [DATE], followed up with normal exercise echo in [DATE].



On first night of admission, patient developed recurrent chest pain when going to the bathroom.  Because of his risk factors for disease, the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit.  He received 3xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation.  RCA with moderate disease.  LCx with distal disease.  

Patient was transferred to the SDU for further care.He was started on beta-blockers and ace-inhibition, and tolerated these medications well.  He was evaluated for cardiac rehab. Of note, patient was informed of the pulmonary nodule located on CT scan and the need for follow-up CT in 3 months.

     region of the left distal ureter at the ureterovesicular junction,

     stable since 1/10/49, and consistent with a nonobstructing distal

     ureteral calculus.

     

     There is a 6 mm hypodensity involving the interpolar region of the

     left kidney which is too small characterize.  There is a

     subcentimeter hyperdense focus involving the lower pole the right

     kidney of apparent (series 2, image 32), stable and possibly

     representing a proteinaceous/hemorrhagic cyst.  There is cortical

     scarring involving the upper pole of left kidney and lower pole

     right kidney.

     PELVIC ORGANS/BLADDER: The prostate gland is enlarged.

     

     PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM: No free air or fluid.

     LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.

     VESSELS: There is mild atherosclerotic calcification involving the

     aorta and its branches.

from walking further.  He will then stop, pain will disappear.  He will continue

walking at which time it will occur at about the same distance.  There is no rest

pain.  The pain had been present for a couple of months although it has been

increasing in severity.   



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for intracranial bleed secondary to an

AV malformation.  He refused surgery at that time at Campellton-Graceville Hospital and has done

well on Dilantin without any seizures.  There has been no further bleed or problem

from this malformation.  He also has treated hypothyroidism.  He is status post

TURP, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy.  He does have a chronic anxiety

disorder for which he is on Ativan intermittently.  He also has pustular psoriasis.



MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 600 mg per day, which keeps his level at about 7.  At

these levels he has had no seizures.  He is also on Synthroid at 0.075 per day.  



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a mostly German-speaking man.  There is a

right-sided tremor which has been present since his intracranial bleed.  Neck

supple.  Blood pressure is at 140/80.  Weight 184.  Heart rate is at 70.  There are

no carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular without gallop or murmur. 

Abdominal exam - No mass, tenderness, or organomegaly.  There are multiple

scars. There is a bruit over the right femoral artery with a decreased pulsation there

compared to the left.  There is no pulse palpable below popliteal on the right side. 

There is no visible ischemic change of the right leg.  The left femoral is fuller, and

there is a palpable dorsalis pedis on that side.  



IMPRESSION:  Peripheral vascular disease, probably right iliofemoral.  He will

undergo arteriovascular studies.  He will also be placed on aspirin at 81 mg per

day.  In addition he is begun on Lipitor 10 mg per day for hyperlipidemia.  He will

follow up following that vascular study.  This evaluation was also communicated to

her daughter, Quinn, because of the language barrier.

NAME:     Usrey, John  

MRN:        6762675



Patient presents for follow-up visit after long hospitalization. He went in to have an

AAA repair and suffered a postop MI. He was in CCU for 3-4 weeks at which time

he sustained a Pseudomonas pneumonia, small bowel obstruction, and PE. He

subsequently had his CABG done at the end of April and was discharged at the end

of May to Grant Clinic. He did well at Grant Clinic and was discharged

from there on the 10th of June, and he presents to me for follow-up today. 



He states that he feels well. He denies any chest pain or trouble breathing since

discharge. He does not remember anything from his hospitalization otherwise. He is

mentally intact. He reports that he has not had a bowel movement for 3 days and had

some pain a couple of days ago. He is passing gas, last done yesterday. No dysuria.

His daughter reports that he is eating well, that he is at his baseline mental status,

that he has had not had any acute complaints at home. 



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As per HPI. Also, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder

due to a congenital AVM, osteoporosis, peripheral vascular disease.



ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 q.d., atenolol 25 b.i.d., Zocor 20 q.h.s.,

Carafate 1 gm p.o. b.i.d., Celexa 10 q.d., multivitamins, thiamine 100 q.d., Seroquel

37.5 q.h.s. and 12.5 q.a.m., Flomax 0.8 q.d., Synthroid 100 q.d., Dilantin 150 p.o. t.i.d.,

Colace 100 t.i.d. 



VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 112/52. Pulse 72. Weight 162. 



PHYSICAL EXAM: General - Elderly male in no acute distress. Appears well in

consideration of his recent long hospitalization. Neck - No JVD or bruits noted

bilaterally. Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rales. CV -

RRR. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs. Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds heard in all 4

quadrants, although mildly decreased. Soft, mildly distended. No masses. No HSM.

No fluid wave. Extremities - He has 1+ firm pitting edema to his mid-shin. 



LABS: From June 13, 2091, show CBC with white count of 4.4, hemoglobin 11.2,

hematocrit 32.2. Chem 7 - BUN 26, creatinine 0.7, glucose 203, Dilantin 5.6. 



ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 76-year-old male, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post CABG in April as

well as AAA repair returns after an extended hospitalization with complications of

pneumonia, SBO, and PE who comes in for follow-up visit. Despite everything,

patient looks well. 



(1)  CV. Will continue cardiac medications at this time. Will likely change Zocor

     back to Lipitor but will check his labs first. Patient would benefit from cardiac

     rehab at this time. He is scheduled to see Dr. Nutter at the end of this

     month. Will arrange for him to have regular cardiac care after this. He has

     seen Dr. Quesnel for his postop CABG issues.



(2)  PVD. Patient status post AAA repair. He has seen Dr. Uddin and is doing

     well. 



(3)  Neuro. Patient on Dilantin 150 t.i.d. as per Dr. Acuna. It would be okay to

     decrease him to 100 t.i.d. as he was before. Will check  his levels today but

     likely decrease to 100 t.i.d. Will refer back to Dr. Acuna for follow-up. 



(4)  Endocrine. Will check TSH. Likely will continue current Levoxyl dose.



(5)  Osteoporosis. Okay to restart Fosamax.



(6)  GI. Patient with constipation. He can start Citrucel or Metamucil twice a day.

     Can also use Dulcolax daily until he has a bowel movement and then decrease

     to every other day as needed. Can also adjust fiber therapy as needed.

     Instructed patient and daughter that if patient is passing gas, it is okay.

     However, if he stops, they should call immediately. 



(7)  Psych. They should continue Celexa and Seroquel for now. Will review charts

     from Grant Clinic to see why medications were started and will likely

     taper him off them.



In general, need to review records from Grant Clinic in order to see what

happened there. Will consider that in my recommendations for his further care.

Return to clinic in 2 weeks.

Internal Medicine Admission Note 



PATIENT: John Usry

MRN: 6762675

DATE: 10/24/98

TIME: 19:00

PCP:  Dr. Xena Acuna

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Dr. Quinton Quintela

HCP/FAMILY CONTACT: 



CHIEF COMPLAINT: &#8220;I came to the hospital b/c I have pneumonia&#8221;



HPI: This is a 84M with CAD s/p 4V CABG in 2091 who presents via transfer from Waverly urgent care after a chest xray showed pneumonia. The patient first presented to Waverly on 10/22 with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks. He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose. He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at Waverly but denied other subjective fevers. His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts. At Waverly labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home. He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better. His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia. He was sent to the CGH for further evaluation.



On presentation to the ED at 1pm on 10/23, his VS were 98.2, 87, 122/60, 97% on 2LNC. He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor. 



Upon arrival to the floor he was in no distress. In addition to the above, he denied recent vomiting, diarrhea or feelings of numbness or dizziness. He has had less appetite recently. He denied injury or trauma to his shoulder which he said had been bothering him more and more for the past 3 weeks.

Nuclear Stress 12/96 CONCLUSION

       The ECG is negative for ischemia.  The sensitivity of

       adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting CAD is limited.

       LV contractile function is normal.

       The perfusion iamges show a large area of mild ischemia involving

       the anteroseptal and inferior walls



TTE: 11/96. EF 60%, mild/mod MR and inferior wall motion abnormalities.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: &#8220;I came to the hospital b/c I have pneumonia&#8221;



HPI: This is a [AGE]M with CAD s/p 4V CABG in [DATE] who presents via transfer from [HOSPITAL] urgent care after a chest xray showed pneumonia. The patient first presented to [HOSPITAL] on [DATE] with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks. He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose. He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at [HOSPITAL] but denied other subjective fevers. His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts. At [HOSPITAL] labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home. He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better. His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia. He was sent to the [HOSPITAL] for further evaluation.



On presentation to the ED at 1pm on [DATE], his VS were 98.2, 87, 122/60, 97% on 2LNC. He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor. 



Upon arrival to the floor he was in no distress. In addition to the above, he denied recent vomiting, diarrhea or feelings of numbness or dizziness. He has had less appetite recently. He denied injury or trauma to his shoulder which he said had been bothering him more and more for the past 3 weeks.

MRN: 71701456 
DOV: 06/19/64

Dear Dr. Ito,

Ida was seen back today for evaluation of Sjogren's as well as left wrist 
pain.  Her Sjogren's has been reasonably stable.  She still remains with 
difficulty in controlling her blood sugar.  She has continued difficulty with 
her oral cavity.  She has had no extraglandular symptoms -- specifically, 
polyneuropathy, myopathy, or purpura.

She uses artificial tears and saliva.  She remains on insulin and estrogens.

She has a one-week history of pain and swelling of her left wrist.  She was 
seen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago.  Radiographs of the 
wrist show chondrocalcinosis.  She was started on Motrin with some response 
but still has active symptoms.  She is wearing a splint.

Today on exam, she is afebrile.  There was OA involving the DIP joints.  PIPs 
and MCPs were nontender.  The left wrist showed swelling and heat with 
diminished motion.  Right wrist showed full range of motion.  Elbows, 
shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis.  
There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.

I aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.  No fluid was obtained.  
I injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.

Clinically, I think she has had pseudogout.  She has chondrocalcinosis on 
radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.  In 
addition, she has primary Sjogren's.  The two diseases are unrelated.

In addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex 
200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.  She should probably 
take that for about five to seven days.  Side effects were reviewed.

I would like to see her back in four months.  She will be returning to you 
for further care in the interim.

ADDENDUM:  At her next visit, I will want her to check her calcium and 
thyroid status since that can be associated with CPPD disease.

With best wishes,

Date of Admission: 06/17/66



Cardiologist: Valdivia



CC: 73 yo woman with h/o Sjogren's syndrome, Diabetes (?Type I), vascular insufficiency who now presents with syncopal episode.

		

HPI:  Ms Rivers was in her USOH until the morning of admission, when she went into the city to buy some buttons and pay a bill at ViewSonic.  She noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning, and she felt as if she may need to eat something.  However, because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment, she decided not to eat.  She continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled).  She saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help.  When she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car.  This is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people.  She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head.  When EMS found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck.  When she arrived at the FMH ED, her blood pressure was 213/97 HR 84 RR20 O2 sat 99% RA Temp 97.3.  She received Labetolol 20 iv, Toradol 30 mg iv, ASA 325 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg po x 1.  Her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s/80s.  She did have one episode of emesis, during which her HR was noted to transiently dip to the 40s (not captured on the monitor); spontaneously recovered to the 60s.

She had a C-spine series and head CT which were negative for acute process, and a CXR which was negative except for R shoulder not well-visualized on CXR.  She was noted to have some superficial bleeding of her posterior scalp, but no obvious laceration.  She was admitted to the SDU because of the episode of bradycardia.

IMPRESSION:

	No evidence of an acute intracranial process.  Ventricular

	dilatation that may be mildly out of proportion to sulcal

	enlargement.



EKG: 

NSR rate 74, J-point elevation V2

____________________________________________



Impression: 

73 yo woman with h/o Sjogren's disease, ?Type I DM now admitted with syncopal event.  DDx includes hypoglycemia, seizure (unlikely), vasovagal episode, arrythmia or ischemia.



Plan: 	

1.Cardiac

Ischemia: Continue ASA, B blocker as tolerated for elevated BP.  Cycle enzymes, monitor EKG for new changes.

Pump: Echo today to assess function, r/o valvular disease or outflow obstruction.

Rhythm: In NSR, continue on monitor to assess for arrythmia.



2. Respiratory: ED CXR shows no significant pulmonary disease.  



3. Endocrine: will continue her home Lantus and use CZI Regular.  Will need to contact HMC re: her care. If she is Type I diabetic, will need basal insulin.  No evidence of DKA on urine or labs.  Check TSH, Hgbaic.



4.  Rheum: h/o Sjogrens, extent of her disease unclear.  Will contact her rheumatologist at RGH.  Consider dedicated R shoulder xray once rules out to assess for possible fx, particularly if pain persists.



5.  Neuro: imaging negative.  She is slow in her responses; monitor closely for evolving neuro sx.

  

6.  GU: Follow urine output.



7.  ID: Afebrile. Normal WBC



8. Hem: HCT stable.  Follow closely



9. F/E/N: replete magnesium, K prn.



10. Prophylaxis: nexium.

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

FREEPORT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL



History of present illness   Ms Rivers was hospitalized 1/22-1/24/67 after presenting to ER with left shoulder pain that evolved to an ache radiating to her chest and forearm, associated with nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness.  In the ER, the pain was characterized as mechanical, but was also relieved by SLNTG (which however precipitated hypotension, brady to 30s). EKG showed only ? slight exaggeration of baseline 1mm ST elevation in V2, V3.  She was heparinized and admitted to SDU.  R/O by serial markers.  Cardiac cath on the day after admission showed a tight RCA (with unclear relationship to anterior ischemia seen on prior stress). She is now s/p Cypher stent, with plans for at least three months of Plavix.



Other issues:

- HgbA1c drawn during office visit was 11.3.

- UTI, pan-sensitive E. coli



Medications added at discharge included levofloxacin x 3 d, Plavix and MVI.  Med list has been updated to reflect discharge orders below.

Hypertension

A:

- 7/11/66: Hypertensive on atenolol 25 qd and lisinopril 20 qd when seen by Dr. Olszewski. He recommended the Omron HEM 711 model for home bp monitoring. Has kept a log of blood pressures, and based on the data, her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg qd and HCTZ 12.5 mg qd was added by Dr. Olszewski. - 8/21/66: Most recent measurements showed typical bp's 130-150/70s, HR 60s-70s. 160/90 in office. Didn't want to increase HCTZ until d/w cardiologist - 9/05: electrolytes wnl on HCTZ; HCTZ increased by Dr. Olszewski - 10/17/66: HCTZ d/c'd, amlodipine started at 5 mg given exacerbation of hypercalcemia - 12/12/67: Remained hypertensive.  D/w Dr. Olszewski and increased amlodipine to 10 mg QD - 1/21/67: BP 130/80 with HR 60 today.  Per Dr. Olszewski clinic note from 1/07/67, SBPs at home 129-135 with HR 60s

Coronary artery disease

A:

- Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, HTN, remote tobacco, postmenopausal - Adenosine-MIBI 6/08/2066:    ECG response to pharmacological stress was  positive for ischemia. The perfusion images are suggestive of a small area of mild anterior ischemia. - TTE 6/2066: dilated LA, mild to moderate MR, borderline symmetric LVH, no SWMA, EF 71%, moderate TR, RVSP 42 mmHg    -1/21/67: No chest pain or SOB 

- Admitted with left shoulder pain 1/22/67. R/o by markers.  Cath 1/23 showed calcified subtotally occluded RCA which was PCI'd with a CYPHER stent (the vessel was on the smaller side and was co-dominant) as well as OM2 and OM3 disease not intervened on because small territory.  

P: 

- 1/23/67:  Plavix x 3 months added to current regimen of ASA, lipitor, atenolol, lisinopril, amlodipine.  Patient also enrolled in HIT Cath study and will need repeat HIT antibody and platelet draw on d3 and d7 post cath.

Old CVA suspected based on exam, including diffuse hyperreflexia and facial asymmetry. Lp(a) and homocysteine wnl. - 1/21/67: No further syncope/presyncope, but still concerned about having sustained head injury 

P: Dischaged from FMH with plans for a loop recorder - received a letter from Dr.K. Ivan Olszewski of the Cardiac Unit who saw Ms. Rivers on 7/11/66.  He reports that results of her event monitor revealed no arrhythmias.  He concurs that her episodes sound like they may be related to vagal episodes. 

- 1/05/67:  f/u brain MRI and EEG scheduled by neuro 

- 1/24/67:  Called patient and reviewed that she will need to reschedule her MRI given her new stent (~8 weeks)

Anemia

A:  Appears to have had Hct ~ 35, MCV ~ 73-74 for > 10 years.  Per patient, has thalassemia trait.  Per pt, has had negative colonoscopy. -1/21/67: B12 was wnl 9/66, but iron studies were omitted

Above.  
 
CONSULTATION REPLY 
 
Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.  I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.  
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.   
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.  He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.  If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.  This is relieved by sitting.  It will happen when walking as well.  This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.  He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.  Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.   
ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.  
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d., Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s. and Selexa.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.  
 
BIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.  
 
EDUCATION:  He is a Consultant who works in Dupont.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has limited exercise and diet.  He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks.  He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use.  He has no HIV risk factors.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.  He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.  He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.  When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.  There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.  Pulse of 60 and regular.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Mental status:  Unremarkable.  Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.  No evidence of retinopathy.  
 
Motor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.  Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.  Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.  Rapid alternating movements intact.   
Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.  Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.  
 
The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.  Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.  Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.  He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.  He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.  
 
DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).  Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.  The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.  
 
ASSESSMENT:  
1.  Neuropathy.  The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.  He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.  He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.  There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.  I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.  I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.  He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.  I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.  
 
Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.  
 
The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.  
 
DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

RE: Otis Narvaez

        MR   #04561326

 

Dear Dr. Huynh:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 

consultation.  As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 

of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.  Recently, he underwent 

evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 

dobutamine stress echocardiography.  The echocardiogram revealed reduced 

left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.  

There was no evidence of ischemia.  He subsequently underwent coronary 

catheterization.  I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 

told that he had no arterial blockages.  Symptomatically, he is 

significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.  He has attributed 

this to his weight.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 

although he has not been taking either of these medications.  Prior to 

his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 

upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.  This was confirmed 

subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 

lung malignancy.  He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 

you.

 

His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 

back pain, and obesity.

 

Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 

q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.  No drug allergies

 

Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.

 

Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.  He smoked for 

40 years but quit approximately three years ago.  He drinks rarely, 

although drank heavily in the past.

December 30,  2072                                         

 

Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.  He denies 

gastrointestinal complaints.

 

On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 

140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.  HEENT is unremarkable, neck 

supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 

without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 

regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 

murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 

CVA tenderness.  No clubbing cyanosis or edema.  Pulses full.

 

Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 

function by echocardiogram.  By report he has no evidence of coronary 

artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.  If indeed 

it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 

this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 

his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.  In any case, this 

puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 

than if he had significant coronary disease.  I see no reason why you 

should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.  Prior 

to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.  

I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 

to South Side Hospital.

 

Sincerely yours,

 

 

 

Kevin Y. Kirkpatrick, M.D.

RE:  Otis Narvaez
     MR #045-61-32-6

Dear Uddin:

Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.  His previous visit with me occurred on
February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.  He
denied chest pain, but did admit to a ""tight"" feeling down his left arm on occasion.  This was not
associated with activity.  He admits to being a very sedentary person.  

The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
LV function, and CT coronary angiography.  There were no significant findings on the clinical
evaluation.  The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion. 
The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
limiting stenosis.  There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging. 
There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.  The
narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.  

A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
342 mg/dl.  He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.  

He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.

Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.  He
denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.  

His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily, 
Otis Narvaez
MR #045-61-32-6
Page 2
March 12, 2077
 
aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.  He usually takes these once every other day.  He is
now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.  He takes this at bedtime.

Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.  This causes him
to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.

He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.  He also has chronic low
back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.  He also has
degenerative joint disease in his knees.  He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
depression.  

He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.

On January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
cell carcinoma.  

On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.  His
weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.  Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
reveals upper dentures in place.  There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear. 
There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.  On cardiac examination, the heart
sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
distal right calf.  There is no edema noted.

I discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac
catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.  He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel
Kraft will perform the procedure.  His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the
catheterization.  After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
comprehensive metabolic profile performed.  He will return to see me in the office again in one
month.

RE:  [PATIENT]
     MR #[MEDICALRECORD]

Dear [DOCTOR]:

[PATIENT] is a [AGE] year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
undergone an Adenosine PET scan on [DATE].  His previous visit with me occurred on
[DATE], where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.  He
denied chest pain, but did admit to a ""tight"" feeling down his left arm on occasion.  This was not
associated with activity.  He admits to being a very sedentary person.  

The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
LV function, and CT coronary angiography.  There were no significant findings on the clinical
evaluation.  The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion. 
The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
limiting stenosis.  There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging. 
There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.  The
narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.  

A lipid profile performed following his office visit on [DATE] revealed a total
cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
342 mg/dl.  He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.  

He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in [DATE], which demonstrated
insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.

Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.  He
denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.  

His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily, 
[PATIENT]

[DATE]
 
aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.  He usually takes these once every other day.  He is
now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.  He takes this at bedtime.

Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.  This causes him
to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.

He was diagnosed with diabetes in [DATE] and hypertension in [DATE].  He also has chronic low
back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.  He also has
degenerative joint disease in his knees.  He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
depression.  

He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at [HOSPITAL] in [DATE].

On [DATE], he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
cell carcinoma.  

On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.  His
weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.  Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
reveals upper dentures in place.  There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear. 
There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.  On cardiac examination, the heart
sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
distal right calf.  There is no edema noted.

I discussed with [PATIENT] and his wife, [PATIENT], my recommendations for a cardiac
catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.  He has agreed to this, and Dr. [DOCTOR] will perform the procedure.  His office will call Mr. [PATIENT] to schedule the
catheterization.  After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
comprehensive metabolic profile performed.  He will return to see me in the office again in one
month.

Best personal regards.

Sincerely,


[DOCTOR], M.D.

                             OFFICE NOTE
 
Address:  26 Burrit St, Marlborough, WI 21145
 
First visit for this 51-year-old white male.
 
1.  Gout.  This has been present for 7 years.  Evaluated at Mary by
Dr. Farrar.  Treated with Colchicine.  He cut down the amount of
organ meats and red meat that he had been eating at the time.  He has
not had any alcohol for 11 years.  Strong family history in his father
and all his brothers.  Continues to have 4 or 5 relatively mild flares
a year which are frequently attributable to forgetting to take the
Colchicine.
 
PMH:  Tonsillectomy.  Cervical radiculitis.  He is a recovering
alcoholic.  No alcohol for 11 years.  Hypertension when he was
drinking.  Hidradenitis.  
 
Meds:  Colchicine 0.6 mg q.d.  
 
ALL:  None.
 
FH:  Father died at 57 from an MI.  Mother at 60 in her sleep. 
Brothers have gout, one has hypertension.
 
SH:  Married for the second time.  His wife is Emily Ippolito another
patient of mine.  They will have been married for one year in May. 
He works as a Patternmaker for McCall in Enid.  He averages 1 1/2
packs of cigarettes a day for the last 35 years.  No alcohol.  No drugs
or HIV exposure.
 
ROS:  Bifocals. Slightly decreased hearing in the left ear.  No chest
pain.  Has a chronic AM cough bringing up 1/4 cup of phlegm daily.  He
occasionally plays tennis and bicycles.  He believes his cholesterol
was 170.  Does like high cholesterol food but has cut back because his
wife has a problem.  He uses seat belts.
 
On physical examination he is a very pleasant large white male.  His
weight is 222 lbs., blood pressure 128/88, heart rate 72.  HEENT -
EOMI, PERL, fundi negative.  Cerumen impacted against the TM's.  Benign
oral cavity examination.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs
clear.  No murmurs or gallops.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No testicular
masses or hernias.  Normal prostate, guaiac negative stool.   Absent
distal pulses.  2+ femoral pulses without any bruits.  1+ reflexes.  No
swelling or tenderness over the first MTP's.  Neurologic exam shows
hearing decreased to watch tick bilaterally.  Air conduction is greater
than bone.  Weber is not lateralized.  
 
Impressions and plans:  1.  Gout.  It sounds like this is really not
much of a problem when he remembers to take the Colchicine.  I
encouraged him to make this a regular habit.  We will check a random
uric acid level.
 
2.  Cardiac risk factors.  He is a male with a very positive family
history who is a smoker.  He has significant cardiac risk factors.  We
spent a long time talking about smoking today.  At his request I gave
him a prescription for Nicoderm patches.  He will start at 21 mg for
six weeks and then move to 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks.  We
will check a cholesterol and he should be less than 200 given his risk
factors.  I pointed out to him his evidence by history of chronic
bronchitis and of peripheral vascular disease.  I think he found this
sobering.
 
3.  General health.  We discussed exercise, cholesterol and seat belts.
We also discussed the use of Q-Tips which I think may also be a
significant contributing factor to his decreased hearing and the
impaction of cerumen.  I recommended ear drops.  We can have him tested
formally when he becomes interested in intervention.

Gregg, Lloyd
MR #657-72-75-7
06/14/80
 
A follow up visit of a 57-year-old white male.  Unfortunately, he
arrived 24 hours late.  
 
He is gradually recovering from a recent flare of his COPD.  This
started with an upper respiratory infection.  He called over the
weekend and was started on prednisone.  He continued to have a
stuttering course over the course of that following week and came
to urgent care the following weekend.  There he was treated with
nebulizers.  He reports that today he was finally able to blow 350
on his peak flow meter.  He is still bringing up lots of junk.  His
gout has been quiescent.  
 
Medications:  Albuterol.  Azmacort.  Colchicine.  Enalapril.  
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Social History:  Married.  His adoption of a 10-year-old girl named
Xiao has been finalized.  He is employed as a sales representative and that
requires a lot of lifting and carrying.  He quit smoking three and
a half years ago.  He drinks no alcohol.
 
Physical Examination:  Looks well.  His weight is 222 pounds.  His
blood pressure is 124/82.  Pulse 76.  HEENT:  EOMI.  No scleral
icterus.  No lymphadenopathy.  His lungs are completely clear
posteriorly and anteriorly.  Distant heart sounds without any
audible murmurs.  Benign abdomen without any hepatomegaly.  No
rectal masses.  Normal prostate.  Guaiac negative stool.  No pedal
edema.  
 
Oxygen saturation on room air is 97 percent.  Peak flow is 320. 
 
Impression: 
1.  COPD.  We discussed this at length.  I think the crucial
component to his treatment will be to anticipate when he is going
to have a flare and responding quickly in a preventative fashion. 
We will have him check his peak flows at the same time every day. 
When he is feeling well his peak flows are always in the 350 range
and he reports that they never go to 300.  When it hits 300 he
should call me or if it is the weekend, he should start immediately
on prednisone 40 mg a day.  
2.  Gout.  Doing well on colchicine.  
3.  Hypertension.  Well controlled.  I will check a creatinine.
4.  General health.  We will check a cholesterol.  His cholesterols
have been good in the past but he has a slightly low HDL.

RE: Lloyd Gregg 

    MR#65772757

 

Dear Xzavior, 

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow

up of his emphysema.

 

The patient reports that he continues to lead a very

active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly 10 hours

a day, frequently lifting 60 pound boxes.  When he

returns home from work he cooks dinner and this

combined with his work schedule and picking up his

daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited

him from a regular exercise program.  Needless to say,

he has remained active.  He is not limited in these

activities by his respiratory function with the

exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with

heavy lifting.  He uses albuterol during these

instances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day. 

His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350

liters per minute.  He knows that when his PEFR falls

to below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for

advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1

burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.

 

His medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220

micrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI

2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec

and the albuterol as mentioned above. 

 

RE: Lloyd Gregg            -2-  November 29,2083 

    MR#65772757

 

The patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of

fevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,

change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.  He does

continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to

frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.  There is

no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.

 

On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress. 

NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.  TM's are clear with

normal light reflexes bilaterally.  His nasal mucosa is notable

for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.  No

significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary

chains.  Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and

prolongation of his expiratory phase.  He has an occasional

expiratory wheeze.  There are no focal findings of consolidation

and air movement is moderate.  No significant JVD and he has a

regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and

there are no murmurs, rubs or S3.  Abdomen is benign without HSM,

focal tenderness or masses.  His extremities are without

clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His weight is 223 pounds. 

Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his

respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation

of 97 percent.

 

My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction

secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen. 

I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active

life.  We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of

prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact

information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of

a flare.  I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.  To

try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of

prednisone through the winter months, we have also begun

Combivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to

be used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.  We talked about

vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the

influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia

vaccine.

 

Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care. 

He will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time

but will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a

flare of his COPD.

continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to

frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.  There is

no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.

 

On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress. 

NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.  TM's are clear with

normal light reflexes bilaterally.  His nasal mucosa is notable

for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.  No

significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary

chains.  Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and

prolongation of his expiratory phase.  He has an occasional

expiratory wheeze.  There are no focal findings of consolidation

and air movement is moderate.  No significant JVD and he has a

regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and

there are no murmurs, rubs or S3.  Abdomen is benign without HSM,

focal tenderness or masses.  His extremities are without

clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His weight is 223 pounds. 

Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his

respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation

of 97 percent.

 

My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction

secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen. 

I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active

life.  We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of

prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact

information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of

a flare.  I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.  To

try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of

prednisone through the [DATE] months, we have also begun

Combivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to

be used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.  We talked about

vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the

influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia

vaccine.

 

Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. [PATIENT]'s care. 

He will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time

but will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a

flare of his COPD.

Record date: 2084-08-25

61 yo man with CAD and PVD referred by Dr. Short for pre-operative evaluation prior to vascular surgery.



He has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well. Returns today feeling well and has been active painting his fence and going up and down stairs without any chest pains or unusual SOB. Has had a hematoma in the groin.



MEDICATIONS:  Serevent.  Flovent.  Enalapril.  Colchicine. Alopurinol.

Albuterol.  Viagra.

 

ALLERGIES:  None. 

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 57 after his 8th MI.  He had his

first one at age 48.  Mother had a stroke in her early 50s.  His brother, Shields,

died a miserable death with recurrent, inoperable laryngeal cancer.

 

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married.  Continues to work as a sales representative.  He

has an adopted child, Xiao who is now 14 and doing very well in school. Quit smoking and drinking a number of years ago.

 



ROS: No chest pains. Chronic shortness of breath. No bowel problems. No bladder problems. Does not exercise. Last cholesterol was  175/42.     The rest of the review of systems was negative. 



PE: General: Looks well.

================ Vital signs ================

Blood Pressure:   150/80 142/80   130/78

Pulse:   84   [Regular, Radial]

Weight:   222   [Pounds]

Skin: Chronic ischemic ulcer on the medial aspect of his second toe of the right foot.

HEENT: EOMI. PEERL. No scleral icterus. Bilateral cataracts. Benign pharynx.

Neck: No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. No cartotid bruits.

Lungs: Decreased breath sounds. Wheezes.

Cor: JVP is normal. PMI is not displaced. Heart sounds barely audible No murmurs. No gallops.

Abd: Normal bowel sounds. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness.

He has a small echymosis of the left inguinal area. Bilateral femoral bruits. 1+ right femoral pulse. I cannot palpate the left pulse.

Extremities: No pedal edema. Ulcer as above.



EKG done in the office shows NSR at 74. Axis 90. Normal intervals. He has Q's in V1-V2 c/w possible OASMI. He has low volts in the precordial leads c/w chronic pulmonary disease. No changes from previous.



================ Problems ================

PRE-OP EVALUATION   He has rest ischemia of the toe. He has three vessel coronary disease that is asymptomatic. There are no indications at this time to push for CABG. He underwent angioplasty to try to improve flow to the anterior wall. His EKG suggests OASMI but his ventriculogram is normal without evidence of MI and EF of 59%. There are studies showing increased risk of in-stent thrombosis, MI, death in patients who have had Plavix stopped for non-cardiac surgery within two weeks of stent. He will be beyond the two week period and Dr. Short is willing to operate on him while continuing Plavix and aspirin. I believe he is an acceptable risk for surgery.



PVD   Will need surgery for ischemic ulcer.



COPD   Doing well and is stable. Instructed to use his inhalers faithfully in the preop period.

       

GOUT    No flares this year.

      

HYPERTENSION    Better when rechecked. He gets nervous with the initial measurements.

      

IMPOTENCE         Discussed the fact that, now that he has documented CAD, there is increased risk with Viagra use. He understands that but indicates that he feels that for him personally the benefits outweigh the risks.

CARDIOLOGY

PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC



Reason for visit:

   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.  She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases



Interval History:

   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.  She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.  



She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.  Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.  She had global hypokinesis.



She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.  She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.  Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.  d dimer 400 rnage.  BNP elevated at 500.  VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.  Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.  Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.  A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.  Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.



The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.  Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.



Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:

Lasix 20mg

Toprol XL 50mg

ASA 325mg

Zestril 20mg

Lantus 10 units hs

Glucovance 2.5/500mg

Multivitamin



She relates that her dyspnea is better



She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.  She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.





Past medical history:

   1. Diabetes

2. Hypertension

3. Hyperlipidemia

4. Sick Sinus syndrome requiring permanant pacemaker

5. cardiomypathy

6. Minimal CAD by cath 2090



Family history:

   No significant cardiac disease



Social history:

   She and her husband are doing well.  She has retired. Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area.



Review of systems:

   Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.  Denies edema, PND, orthopnea.  Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.



Physical examination:

-BP: 130/80  

-General appearance:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   CVP 8.  No carotid bruits

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   S1 S2.   No significant murmurs.  PMI normal.

-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, no hepatosplenomegly

-Extremities:   Good pulses, no edema

-Neuro:   Non-focal

-Pulse: 89  



EKG:

   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.



Impression:

   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.



Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.



She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.  Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.



At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.



Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.



In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.  She relates that she will call our office.

The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.  Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.



Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:

Lasix 20mg

Toprol XL 50mg

ASA 325mg

Zestril 20mg

Lantus 10 units hs

Glucovance 2.5/500mg

Multivitamin



She relates that her dyspnea is better



She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.  She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.





Past medical history:

   1. Diabetes

2. Hypertension

3. Hyperlipidemia

4. Sick Sinus syndrome requiring permanant pacemaker

5. cardiomypathy

6. Minimal CAD by cath [DATE]



Family history:

   No significant cardiac disease



Social history:

   She and her husband are doing well.  She has retired. Daughter is finished with college and [PROFESSION] in the [CITY] area.



Review of systems:

   Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.  Denies edema, PND, orthopnea.  Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.



Physical examination:

-BP: 130/80  

-General appearance:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   CVP 8.  No carotid bruits

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   S1 S2.   No significant murmurs.  PMI normal.

-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, no hepatosplenomegly

-Extremities:   Good pulses, no edema

-Neuro:   Non-focal

-Pulse: 89  



EKG:

   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.



Impression:

   Ms. [PATIENT] is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.



Her evaluation at [HOSPITAL] for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.



She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.  Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.



At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.



Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.



In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.  She relates that she will call our office.

Record date: 2085-04-22

 
This patient wants to transfer his care from the McCook Erie Clinic to me. He 
got 
my name from a nurse who works in the hospital.  HE is a 58 year old white 
male retired Transportation Manager with a number of issues.  
1)  He had a cyst or a mass enlarge in his R submental region which was 
excised 
at the McCook Erie Clinic.  Note from his surgeon there said the path showed 
nonkaziating granuloma.  I hope cultures are pending.  The patient does 
volunteer at a homeless shelter so could  certainly be exposed to TB or 
atypical mycobacteria.  
2)  The patient has know mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation followed 
at the MEC by a cardiologist. He had a stress test in the last year that was 
benign. Never had CHF or endocarditis.  
3)  Social situation.  The patient is a sober alcoholic and sober for the 
last 
2 years however he went through divorce probably because of his alcoholism 
10 years ago and took early retirement from Brookdale Metro Systems because 
of his alcoholism. He stays sober by going to meetings and also 
volunteering at the McCook Clinic. He lives with a woman. He has good 
relations with his grown children and his grand children.  His woman friend 
is very supportive and the patient is now feeling good enough about himself 
that he is ready to try and get work full time.  Previous attempts to do so 
have resulted in failure because of his Hx of alcoholism and his premature 
retirement.
 
Family Hx. Father died at age 79 of Altzheimers and some kind of cancer ? 
throat cancer.  His mother had diabetes and coronary artery disease and she 
died of colon cancer. The patient himself had a colonoscopy within the last 
year and it was normal.  One brother and 2 sisters, one of the sisters also 
has mitral valve disease. 
 
Past medical Hx the alcoholism and he was stabbed in the L hand I think in 
2059 and that was repaired. He also had a TNA in childhood. 
 
He has no known allergies to medications.
 
The only medication he takes is Lisinopril 5 mg for blood pressure. He was 
only started on this in the last year. He also takes a vitamin a day.
 
His other significant medical complaint is erectile dysfunction.  He has 
normal libido and good sexual drive however he tends to lose erection after 
he 
has gone for a few minutes.  He can achieve vaginal penetration.  His live in 
lover has been supportive but she would like him to have better performance 
and so would he. He does wake up in the morning frequently with erections. He 
has no known Hx of diabetes.  No prolonged hypertension or vascular disease.  
 
Social Hx.  The patient eats fairly well. He walks usually a mile or so a 
day.  
He does not do any aerobic activity. He does smoke  to a pack a day and has 
for many, many years.  He does wear seat belts when he drives and does not do 
any elicit drugs.  On system review:  Weight stable.  No change in skin. He 
always had a very gravelly voice.  He has had no change in his vision. He is 
very deaf in the L ear.  He has a morning cough no hemoptysis.  Cough is 
about 
a teaspoon of white/gray sputum. He has no dyspnea on exertion.  He has no 
angina.  No palpitations.  No presyncope or syncope.  NO claudication. He has 
no dysphagia. He has no epigastric discomfort.  No change in his bowel 
movements and no rectal bleeding.  He has no claudication.  No edema and no 
joint pains. No headaches and no low back pain.  No long bone pain.  He has 
no 
heat or cold intolerance.  He has no easy bruisability.  
 
PE: shows him to 5'7"".  155 lbs.  Skin benign.  Nails do show some early 
clubbing. No cyanosis.  Normal no AV knicking.  Flat disks. Pupils equally 
round and reactive to light and accommodation at 3 mm. Nares normal.  TMs 
normal. Hearing is markedly diminished in the L ear. Head is normal cephalic. 
Thyroid not enlarged.  There is the scar at the site of his excision under 
the 
mandible. No associated adenopathy on either R or L neck or axilla or the 
supraclavicular region.  He is hyperesonant to percussion.  He has distant 
breath sounds. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes. He has normal S1.  Normal S2 and 
holosystolic blowing 2-3/6 mid systolic murmur radiates best to the axilla. 
No 
radiation to the clavicles. No carotid bruits.  Jugular venous pulsation to 7 
sonometers. Abdomen is soft and non tender. There is no enlargement of the 
liver. No adeventitious masses. There is a L inguinal weakness without frank 
hernia.  Phallus uncircumsized. Testes normal. Prostate is a little difficult 
feel because he has a band around the anal sphincter which makes it difficult 
for me to get beyond but I felt probably half of his prostate and it was 
normal and smooth. Stool was guac negative. Reflexes 3+ and equal throughout 
and normal vibratory sense and touch. Normal gait and station.
 
Assessment and Plan:
 
1)  Recent rapidly growing mass under the R mandible showing nonkaziating 
granuloma.  Culture is pending and we will plant a PPD and control early 
next week. I will have him tracked down the report of this from the MEC and 
get culture reports and will get chest x-ray today both for his COPD to 
rule out a cavitary lesion.  
2)  Alcoholism now sober.
3)  Erectile dysfunction try Viagra. He was given appropriate warnings and 
instructions.  I gave him 100 mg # 7.  
4)  Mitral valve prolapse by auscultation followed by cardiologist at the MEC.
5)  We spent a long time talking about smoking cessation.  He has some 
Wellbutrin at home from when he was depressed while getting sober and I 
encouraged him to take 150 b.i.d. and we made a plan for him to try and 
quit.   I will see patient again next week to plant a PPD and then see him 
again in about a month to see how he is doing.  We will certainly check the 
chest x-ray to make sure he did not have active cavitary disease.

Mr. Ostrander is here for follow-up of his thyroid situation, however due to 
scheduling difficulties he is only having his thyroid uptake and scan 
currently.  He took the tracer and he had his first scan now and the 
testing wont be done until tomorrow.  Thyroid function tests were 
completely normal.  His chest x-ray is completely normal except for 
tracheal deviation I believe which is due to his goida.  I talked to him 
that if the nodule were cold we will need a fine needle aspirate.  I also 
said to him that he made need to see a thyroid specialist.  Though 
slightly anxious he is agreeable to this.
 
He did not bring with him the pathology final report of his lymph node 
biopsy but he was told it was a reaction to an infection and no further 
follow-up or treatment was necessary.
We then talked about smoking cessation and he and his live-in have picked 
a date namely Jun 8th to quit .I tried to give him as much encouragement 
for that as I could.

&#183; Urinalysis:  negative



&#183; Radiology: CXR:  IMPRESSION:

     Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly. 

       

&#183; EKG: Regular rate, sinus rhythm, indeterminate versus right axis. Frequent PVCs, Anterior Q waves, prolonged QT



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 yo m w/ likely new onset CHF.  Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.  Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.



I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.  His murmur is quite impressive.  Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. He is also a smoker.  



Another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.



1.        CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam.  Will give another dose of lasix 40 IV tonight.  Start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control BP.  Repeat echo in the am.  Strict I/Os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.  If EF is depressed, will start beta blocker, consider aldactone.

2.        Substance abuse &#8211; Will obtain Johnson Rehab consult for alcohol and cigarettes.

3.        HTN &#8211; Poorly controlled, captopril

4.        Elevated blood sugar &#8211; Will obtain fasting BSs and right for sliding scale insulin.  Will obtain HgbA1C

5.        Hyperlipidemia &#8211; LDL 128 in 2090.  Will start statin and check fasting lipid panel in am.

6.        Restless leg syndrome &#8211; Likely 2/2 iron deficiency anemia.  Will replete till ferritin &gt; 50 before treating

7.        Iron deficiency anemia &#8211; Will start iron sulfate, recheck ferritin.



F/E/N:  low salt, low fat/cholesterol diet

CC:  SOB

  

HPI:  [AGE] yo m w/ past medical history of mitral valve prolapse, alcoholism, and smoking presents w/ 2 weeks progressive shortness of breath on exertion, PND, lower extremity edema, and orthopnea.  Over the past two weeks, he can no longer walk more than a block, whereas in the past he could walk &gt; 100 yards (and per his daughter, as far as he wanted).  He states that at night he wakes up short of breath and has to dangle his feet off the side of the bed, when he noticed they were quite swollen.  Additionally, he has trouble lying on his back, and has to either lay on his side or prop himself up, which is new.  He does not report any chest pain, or history of MI.  He has had a cough x 1-2 weeks as well.  



In the ED his intial vitals were AF 114/92 117 18 99% RA and he received Tylenol, albuterol, atrovent, a one liter bolus, and furosemide 20 IV x 2, 125 mg IV solumedrol, and his BNP returned at 10,765.  He had a CXR showing cardiomegally and pulmonary edema.

&#183; Radiology: CXR:  IMPRESSION:

     Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly. 

       

&#183; EKG: Regular rate, sinus rhythm, indeterminate versus right axis. Frequent PVCs, Anterior Q waves, prolonged QT



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: [AGE] yo m w/ likely new onset CHF.  Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.  Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in [DATE].



I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in [DATE].  His murmur is quite impressive.  Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. He is also a smoker.  



Another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.



1.        CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam.  Will give another dose of lasix 40 IV tonight.  Start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control BP.  Repeat echo in the am.  Strict I/Os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.  If EF is depressed, will start beta blocker, consider aldactone.

2.        Substance abuse &#8211; Will obtain [HOSPITAL] consult for alcohol and cigarettes.

3.        HTN &#8211; Poorly controlled, captopril

4.        Elevated blood sugar &#8211; Will obtain fasting BSs and right for sliding scale insulin.  Will obtain HgbA1C

5.        Hyperlipidemia &#8211; LDL 128 in [DATE].  Will start statin and check fasting lipid panel in am.

6.        Restless leg syndrome &#8211; Likely 2/2 iron deficiency anemia.  Will replete till ferritin &gt; 50 before treating

7.        Iron deficiency anemia &#8211; Will start iron sulfate, recheck ferritin.



F/E/N:  low salt, low fat/cholesterol diet

EDVISIT^93295529^OSTRANDER, BILL^04/22/95^OXENDINE, LAWRENCE

Seen and evaluated with resident, Dr. Castro.  I have reviewed

her note and assessment and plan, and I agree.  I have seen and

evaluated the patient myself.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old

gentleman with past medical history of alcoholism, as well as

depression.  He has had a small-bowel obstruction in the past as

well as CABG x2, PTSD, and high cholesterol, now presenting to

the Emergency Room in the setting of having been separated from

his girlfriend of 15 years secondary to his excessive alcohol use

and drinking very heavily over the last week.  He was found in a

bar intoxicated, and upon EMS arrival stated that he wanted help

with his drinking problem as well as the fact that he was

depressed without any SI or HI.  He is also stating that he has

not taken any food in the last week, just alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He is denying any chest pain, shortness of

breath, any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, any headache or blurred

vision or any fall or trauma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As above.

MEDICATIONS:  He is on unknown medications.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

ALLERGIES:  Current heavy alcohol use.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Does smoke cigarettes, but does not use illicit

drugs.  He is a retired transporation manager, and he was previously

living with his girlfriend, but has now been living alone for the

last week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When he presented, he had a heart rate of

65, respiratory rate of 16, BP of 150/79, and saturating 99% on

room air.  He was afebrile at 96.7.  He was alert, interactive,

appropriate, somewhat slurred speech, but gave a good history of

signs and symptoms.  HEENT exam:  He is nonicteric with dry

mucous membranes.  Heart was regular rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs

were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft and

minimally diffusely tender.  He had no evidence of trauma and

pain to palpation in his extremities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a patient with severe alcohol

abuse, now presenting in the setting of an alcohol binge with no

p.o. food intake.  We did send laboratory studies notable for an

elevated white count of 9 as well as hyponatremia at 124, down

from 135 previously.  Please see the resident note for full

details.  His alcohol level was 277.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  We did treat the patient with IV

fluid as well as D5.  We did give him a p.o. diet here in the

Emergency Department and we monitored him for withdrawal signs. 

In addition, we contacted social work for help with his alcohol

dependence/abuse, and he will be admitted to the Ochsner for

further management of his hyponatremia as well as his alcohol

abuse.  We also treated him with multivitamins.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Alcohol intoxication

2.  Alcohol dependence

3.  Depression.

4.  Hyponatremia.

REPORT
     BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM
     The present study is compared to previous films.
     There are scattered fibroglandular densities.
     There is architectural distortion and skin and trabecular
     thickening involving the left breast that are consistent with post
     treatment changes.  There is no evidence of new or recurrent
     disease.
     No suspicious mass, calcifications or architectural distortion are
     identified in the right breast.  A clip and calcifications are
     noted in the upper outer quadrant from prior benign percutaneous
     biopsy.
     There is no mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right
     breast.
     

IMPRESSION
     Post treatment changes involving the left breast with no evidence
     of new or recurrent disease.
     No mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right breast.

Impression and Plan:

1) Uncontrolled DM: A bit improved. Now with premeal values mostly in low 200s. Will increase to 1000 mg qpm since her AM values seem to be higest. Eventually will need to be on maximal doses of metformin (2550 mg qd). Hypoglycemic event management reviewed.
Still with frequent dietary indiscretions, such as eating candy and pizza on regular basis.

2) Diet modification reviewed.

3) HTN/proteinuria: Not optimally controlled. WIll add atenolol for now. Rationale for this reviewed with pt. Cont. ACEI and adjust next time based on microalbumin. Previously referred to renal for eval.

4) Osteoporosis: Stable. Cont. Fosamax. Reviewd proper use-drinking of water and staying upright for at least 30 minutes after taking pill.

5) Smoking: 5 cigs per day per pt. Risks and options discussed. Urged cessation.

REPORT
     BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM
     The present study is compared to previous films.
     There are scattered fibroglandular densities.
     There is architectural distortion and skin and trabecular
     thickening involving the left breast that are consistent with post
     treatment changes.  There is no evidence of new or recurrent
     disease.
     No suspicious mass, calcifications or architectural distortion are
     identified in the right breast.  A clip and calcifications are
     noted in the upper outer quadrant from prior benign percutaneous
     biopsy.
     There is no mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right
     breast.
     

IMPRESSION
     Post treatment changes involving the left breast with no evidence
     of new or recurrent disease.
     No mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right breast.
     BI-RADS Category 2 Benign Finding

Impression and Plan:

1) Uncontrolled DM: A bit improved. Now with premeal values mostly in low 200s. Will increase to 1000 mg qpm since her AM values seem to be higest. Eventually will need to be on maximal doses of metformin (2550 mg qd). Hypoglycemic event management reviewed.
Still with frequent dietary indiscretions, such as eating candy and pizza on regular basis.

2) Diet modification reviewed.

3) HTN/proteinuria: Not optimally controlled. WIll add atenolol for now. Rationale for this reviewed with pt. Cont. ACEI and adjust next time based on microalbumin. Previously referred to renal for eval.

4) Osteoporosis: Stable. Cont. Fosamax. Reviewd proper use-drinking of water and staying upright for at least 30 minutes after taking pill.

5) Smoking: 5 cigs per day per pt. Risks and options discussed. Urged cessation. 

6) H/o breast cancer: Stable. F/u with [DOCTOR] [DATE] and Dr.[DOCTOR] [DATE].

7) abnormal LFTs: recheck in a couple of months.

8) H/o noncompliance: reviewed in detail with pt. ""busy schedule of appts"". Urged compliance.

MICROBIOLOGY: None


RADIOLOGY
1. CXR: Lungs:  The lungs are satisfactorily inflated. There is increasing
prominence of the interstitium and peribronchial cuffing when compared to the prior study consistent with interval development of CHF.  Surgical clips are again noted projected over the left lower hemithorax.  No definite focal consolidation is demonstrated. Pleura:  There is no pneumothorax. The hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study.  This could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of CHF, but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with CHF.


2. Bilateral LENIs: NO EVIDENCE OF FEMORAL OR POPLITEAL DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS OF
EITHER LEG.


EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 95. Normal axis. Normal PR, QRS, QT intervals. No ST elevations or depressions.  ? Q waves in v1, v2, v3 but also may be upslopes before the downslops. However new since 12/12/2074




ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN


Mrs. Ito is a 69F with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephritic syndrome, and 1/15/2075 R humerus ORIF presenting from Crest Nursing Home with SOB and HTN. Her exam and imaging is consistent with pulmonary edema, as she has had in the past. The precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear, however. She describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive. It is possible that HTN 2/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema.  Conversely, however, CHF may have precipitated her HTN.
 
1. Shortness of breath/CHF: Evidence of volume overload by exam and imaging. PE also on the differential but seems less likely given improvement of resp status, negative LENIs. 
-- Lasix 40mg IV now 
-- Strict I+O
-- Daily weights
-- F/up PA/Lat
-- Continuous O2 sat monitor;Telemetry, cardiac monitor
-- f/up cardiac enzymes
-- ASA 325 qd
-- Will give Lopressor 25 Q8 and Captopril 50 Q8 for now but may need to reconsider the BB if CHF less compensated. 
-- Albuterol and atrovent for possible COPD component given tobacco history
-- Consider TTE in AM
-- Consider PFTs


2. Leukocytosis: Infection vs stress response. Patient presents with elevated WBC with 80% polys. Infectious work-up has included U/A that is negative for infection. CXR does not show evidence of focal consolidation, however may be obscured by pulmonary edema. Mental status at baseline. I am suspicious for PNA given her report of productive cough howeve do not feel pressed to treat at this time as she is afeb. 
-- Cont to follow fever curve and WBC
-- F/up PA/Lat

Ms. [PATIENT] is a [AGE]-year-old female with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephrotic syndrome, and [DATE] R humerus ORIF presenting from [HOSPITAL] with SOB and HTN. She was discharged from [HOSPITAL] to rehab on [DATE] after ORIF of a right humeral fracture. She feels that she has been doing fairly at rehab. On the evening prior to admission, however, she had some anxiety that resolved after receiving Ativan from her nurse. She then was able to fall asleep but woke-up at 2AM with diaphoresis and SOB. She denied chest pain. She was attended to and her BP was 220/117. She was given 2 SL NTG, O2, and Lasix, after which her SOB somewhat improved but her HTN continued. She also complains of a chronic cough that is productive of white/yellow sputum.

ID:  T2 N 0 M X, ER/PR + Her 2 Neu negative left invasive ductal carcinoma


Reason for visit: Monitoring of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer


Initial Oncologic History:  
Ms. Ito first palpated a left breast lump in 2070. Two years later she was seen by her PCP and referred to surgery. In March '72 a mammogram showed a 1.6 cm left breast mass at 12 o'clock, also evident on ultrasonography. An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. 
On 3/22/72 a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On 5/31/72 she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,  with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative. She was then referred to multidisciplinary clinic and received a recommendation for whole breast irradiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy.


INTERVAL HISTORY:  
Returns to see us for regular 6 month follow up. She had follow up chest imaging with her PCP which did not show evidence of pna. She is happy to hear this. She reports she is doing well at home. Son agrees. He is in the process of remodeling her home so it is handicap accessible. She can dress herself and wash herself. No new breast symptoms, pain or other concerns today.
Mammogram due this month, this is booked. She takes the arimidex daily and has noted no untoward effects.

Cell Son [PATIENT] [PHONE] 


ID:  T2 N 0 M X, ER/PR + Her 2 Neu negative left invasive ductal carcinoma


Reason for visit: Monitoring of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer


Initial Oncologic History:  
Ms. [PATIENT] first palpated a left breast lump in [DATE]. Two years later she was seen by her PCP and referred to surgery. In [DATE] a mammogram showed a 1.6 cm left breast mass at 12 o'clock, also evident on ultrasonography. An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. 
On [DATE] a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On [DATE] she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,  with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative. She was then referred to multidisciplinary clinic and received a recommendation for whole breast irradiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy.


INTERVAL HISTORY:  
Returns to see us for regular 6 month follow up. She had follow up chest imaging with her PCP which did not show evidence of pna. She is happy to hear this. She reports she is doing well at home. Son agrees. He is in the process of remodeling her home so it is handicap accessible. She can dress herself and wash herself. No new breast symptoms, pain or other concerns today.

Dear Ms. Gustafson, 


I have just received your test results and I would like to share them with you.



Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 7.30 on 01/29/2123. It has remained stable compared to the last value of 7.10 on 10/29/2122. Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months. We would like to keep it below 7.


I suggest a trial of metformin 500mg twice daily
test your sugars to keep below 140 2 hours after meals

If you have any questions about these results, please do not hesitate to contact me.

HPI: The pt has not had any significant recent CV history.  When pressed, she notes that about 6 months ago, she had an episode of mild chest tightness while at rest which was not particularly severe nor was it exacerbated or relieved by any measures.  These sx occurred only once, and lasted for a ""few hours"" before abating.  She reports that she thought it might be ""heartburn,"" though she is not prone to dyspepsia.  Subsequently, she denies any exertional dyspnea, CP, jaw or arm pain, belching, post-prandial discomfort, ""heartburn"" or palpitations.  She has not had any sx of CHF including pnd, orthopnea or LE edema.  Moreover, she denies claudication (legs or arms).  She reports that she has a ""sedentary"" lifestyle, but still carries groceries, does laundry, and usual housework without limitation.  She presented to her PCP Dr. Ong for an annual physical recently and on ECG, he noted new inferior Q waves and referred her for ETT which she had today.  As noted below, she had an early positive ECG with NO symptoms of angina, but with marked light-headedness with STD and bigeminy lasting up to 20' into recovery.  Scans were notable for EF 51% with inferior HK and an inferior fixed defect and inferolateral ischemia.  She was then transferred to BH ED and here to MMC for angiography.

	Assessment and plan:
   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.  From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.  I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.  She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).  She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.

1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.  NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.  Will discuss with Drs. Harper/Kumar tomorrow.  Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.  She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.  She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
3) Secondary prevention as above
4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.  Follow sugars while in house
5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

	Reason for visit:
   Cardiology Admission note for + ETT


	Interval History:
   CC/ID: [AGE] yo female w/ CRFs of DM2, HTN, Chol admitted after +ETT.

HPI: The pt has not had any significant recent CV history.  When pressed, she notes that about 6 months ago, she had an episode of mild chest tightness while at rest which was not particularly severe nor was it exacerbated or relieved by any measures.  These sx occurred only once, and lasted for a ""few hours"" before abating.  She reports that she thought it might be ""heartburn,"" though she is not prone to dyspepsia.  Subsequently, she denies any exertional dyspnea, CP, jaw or arm pain, belching, post-prandial discomfort, ""heartburn"" or palpitations.  She has not had any sx of CHF including pnd, orthopnea or LE edema.  Moreover, she denies claudication (legs or arms).  She reports that she has a ""sedentary"" lifestyle, but still carries groceries, does laundry, and usual housework without limitation.  She presented to her PCP Dr. [DOCTOR] for an annual physical recently and on ECG, he noted new inferior Q waves and referred her for ETT which she had today.  As noted below, she had an early positive ECG with NO symptoms of angina, but with marked light-headedness with STD and bigeminy lasting up to 20' into recovery.  Scans were notable for EF 51% with inferior HK and an inferior fixed defect and inferolateral ischemia.  She was then transferred to [HOSPITAL] ED and here to [HOSPITAL] for angiography.

Patient Name: LAGNSTON, SHERMAN I.;  MRN: 7223692
Dictated at: 12/09/67 by GARY J. HUGHES, MD 

 
FOLLOW UP NOTE 
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Renal cell carcinoma, presumably metastatic to T1.  Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray:  Three months.  
 
TUMOR STATUS:  Not available.  
 
NORMAL TISSUE STATUS:  No difficulty.  
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology.  He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.  He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.  He has no weakness in any extremities.  His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little ""fuzzy.""  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he looks well.  His weight is up to 230 pounds.  He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout.  His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression.  
 
PLAN:  I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan.  Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.  Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure.

HPI:   	 

61 yo male (CRF:former smoker, HTN, obesity) present with 4-5 days of increasing chest pain.  



Patient reports that he began having pain at the R sternal border, no radiation 4-5 days ago.  Patient unsure when pain initially began.  Patient describes suprasternal pain, sharp pain that felt like  gas pain.   Initially lasting for minutes.  Pain came and went without any correlation with activity.  Episodes increased in frequency and intensity over the days.  Exercise did not worsen his pain and was able to climb 2-3 flights of stairs without exacerbation of symptoms.  



Pain has been increasing in intensity over the past 4-5 days.  Pain became unbearable and patient finally presented to BRA. Pt did not have any clear STE's,  given IV nitro, heparin, and ASA.  Evaluated by BRA Cardiologist and transferred to CCH CCU for further workup.

GI CONSULT NOTE 								10/27/2070



Patient: Langston, Sherman

Unit #: 7223692

Location: Ol 11

Referring Attending: Null



Reason for consult:  BRBPR



HPI: The patient is a 62 year old male with history of CAD s/p stents of LAD lesion in February 2070 readmit with chest pain.  At the time of this stenting, he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals.  He presented with recurrent CP in May, and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent.  This admission he had a 10-15 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring.  The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins.  He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin.  In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT >150, he had one episode, moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding.  Since transfer, still on heparin, he had no further bleeding, nor guiac positive stool until today.   This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative.  Following this, after returning to bed, he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum.  He had no abdominal pain.  No further bleeding since this morning.  He has never had rectal bleeding previously on aspirin and plavix.  His colonoscopy in 2066 revealed diverticulosis.  He is currently on aspirin, plavix, heparin with therapeutic PTT.

No prior EGD - had an ENT exam at Ridge Family Practice



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

62 year old male with CAD with chest pain to be evaluated by cardiac cath with painless BRBPR following a large bowel movement today in the setting of heparin, aspirin and plavix.  This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.  He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.  There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.  There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.  Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.  No alteration in medications required.

No prior EGD - had an ENT exam at [HOSPITAL]



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

[AGE] year old male with CAD with chest pain to be evaluated by cardiac cath with painless BRBPR following a large bowel movement today in the setting of heparin, aspirin and plavix.  This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.  He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.  There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.  There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.  Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.  No alteration in medications required.

Personal data and overall health

			

  This is a 63-year-old man status post renal cell CA and coronary artery disease.



Reason for visit

			

  Followup multiple medical problems.



Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

The patient had recatheterization in May demonstrating 30% stenosis at the stent on the LAD.  He has diffuse disease, otherwise with good collateralization.  His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance, but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia.  His Duke ETT score was -10, but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly.  He had infero-apical hypokinesis with an EF of 45%.  It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise.  The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly.  He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth.  He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently.  He also occasionally feels this at rest.  He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90.  He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging.  It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know.  He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks.     01/13/2072: .  The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2070.  He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue.  He has no chest pain or palpitations.  He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 50 mg BID may be too much.  He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 50.  He has no symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.  He does have cold extremities.  There is no weight gain, weight loss, or orthopnea.  He remains on beta blocker, lipitor, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, and warfarin.  He is no longer on Plavix.  He has no nitrate.  On exam, he is somewhat hypertensive, but lungs are good and there is no elevated JVP.  His EKG shows first-degree AV block and I have asked him to bring that to Dr.  Null's office today.  

A: Stable. 

P: Continue medicines as they are because of borderline blood pressure today.  We would not escalate



Elevated blood pressure

The patient is on Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol.  He states his blood pressure at home is usually quite good and he feels it is responsive to external stressors.  I have asked him to think hard about removing those stressors from his life in order to maintain health.



Hyperlipidemia

The patient remains on 40 mg of lipitor.  It has been a year since we have checked his excellent results and we will check today.  He has been fasting for 12 hours.



Iron deficiency anemia

We will recheck his indices today.  He is not fatigued or pale.



Renal carcinoma

The patient had repeat MRI and CT in January at the Healthwin Hospital.  These were read as stable and he needs no intervention other than continued monitoring at six-month intervals.  He is quite reassured by this.



Seborrheic keratosis

The patient is ready for evaluation by Dermatology.  He has several atypical-looking keratoses as well as poorly rounded lesions consistent with BCCs.  I have referred him to Dermatology today.



Sinus congestion

/ 5/10/64=&gt;/and stuffiness, no ear ache, no sore throat, no shaking, chills (saw Dr.  I have reinforced the wisdom of taking some nasal steroid at HS.

RE:  Peggy Tinsley
     MR #236-67-03-3
 
Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.  This patient
with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.  She has been doing well
except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
the past week.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
pain.  She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.  Her blood
sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.  
 
Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
NPH 10 units qam.
 
On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.  CBC at the time
revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.  Blood
cultures were sent.
 
On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
and a pulse of 88.  She was afebrile.  Head and neck examination
was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.  On cardiovascular
examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
peripheral edema.  Heart sounds were normal.
 
Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
protein and 2+ glucose.
 
Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center. 
There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection. 
She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
tract infection.  Because of her early satiety she has been
eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.

Re:  Peggy Tinsley

Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the Renal Clinic today.  Her chief
symptomatic complaint is severe pruritus, which has not improved
much with Benadryl.  She has yet to fill the prescription for Sarna
lotion.  Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium, and she brought in
samples for cultures today.  Her appetite has improved somewhat.
She notes exertional fatigue and shortness of breath.  Medications
include Phoslo 1 tablet t.i.d., Lasix 160 mg b.i.d., Altase  2.5 mg
b.i.d., Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d., NPH 10 units q.d., iron t.i.d.
 
On examination, weight was 46.8 kilos, which is stable.  Heart rate
was 72, blood pressure 130/64.  JVP was clearly seen at 6 cm
greater than the sternal angle, and there was 1 plus peripheral
edema.  There was no S3.  Chest examination revealed bibasilar
inspiratory crackles.  Her left hand is no longer cold, but the
PTFE graft remains slightly edematous.
 
Blood work from May 30th showed a hematocrit of 23, potassium 5.2,
bicarbonate 15, BUN 91, creatinine 7.9, calcium 5.5., phosphate
5.2, albumin 3.4.
 
We will continue to hold off on dialysis until such time as Peggy's
PTFE graft is suitable.  This will save her the additional
morbidity of a semipermanent IJ catheter.  She is more hypervolemic
than last week, and I added Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg in the morning to her
diuretic regimen.  By oversight, she was not started on Rocaltrol,
and I have started her on Rocaltrol .25 mcg p.o. q.d., and
Nephrocaps 1 p.o. q.d.

Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.  In summary, she is
a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.  By
report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,
peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.  In viewing
her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.  Her
three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.  She does,
however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and
on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.  These episodes are
relieved by nitroglycerin.  Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
by slowing down.  
 
     In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.  Her
cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.  I don't have
fractionations and her family history is unknown.  
 
     A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild
ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,
preserved LV size and function.  She had an exercise tolerance test
in February of 2085.  On a modified protocol, she went for less
than 4 1/2 minutes.  This is equivalent to not even completing
stage 1 of the standard Bruce.  With that, she did develop chest
pain and had 2 mm of ST depression. That study was accompanied by
both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
ischemia.  As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope
portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.  
 
     That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I
only have the report.  However, from this report, there was
preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies. 
Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of
proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
LAD.  The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.  The
right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
stenosis.  At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical
therapy.  
 
     Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every
other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice
daily insulin therapy.  
 
     In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures
have involved the hemodialysis access.  She has had one pregnancy
28 years ago without complications.  I also elicited a history of
some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.  This
was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.
 
     On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90
regular, her weight 95 lbs.  Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
arm.  There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not
distended.  Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained. 
There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the
apex.  Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities
were without edema.  The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,
diffuse STT changes.  There were no pathologic Q waves.
 
     Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac
status.  She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both
shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has
limited functional capacity.  The coronary angiography reveals a
presence of multi-vessel disease.  Even without seeing the primary
data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that
she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.  
Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery 
bypass surgery. 
 
 
     Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak
with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.  I
would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only
10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.  As
indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her
suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling
symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more
pressing.
 
     I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in
her care.
 
 
                                   Sincerely,

Lydia Levine
MR #813-25-60-5
March 20, 2076
 
Ms. Levine is a 50-year-old, perimenopausal woman with non-
insulin dependent diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a history
of tobacco use, who underwent a recent cardiac catheterization
for a positive stress test.  At catheterization she had a
proximal 60% lesion in her RCA as well as a mid 60-70% RCA
lesion, obtuse marginal lesion of 60%, and an LAD mid lesion of
60%.  At the time it was decided to continue medical therapy on
Ms. Levine.  Since her cardiac catheterization approximately two
weeks ago, she has had no recurrent symptoms of chest pain.  She
continues on her medicines including Lopid 500 mg b.i.d.,
atenolol, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as
well as her oral hypoglycemic medicines.
 
Physical Examination:  She is an obese, white female in no acute
distress.  Her vital signs are stable.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation.  Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She has no
peripheral edema.
 
Electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70,
axis of about 46, and there are no acute ST-T changes noted.
 
Impression/Plan:  We will continue Ms. Levine on her current
cardiac regimen.  She has three-vessel coronary artery disease,
non-obstructive in nature.  As long as she remains asymptomatic
on her current medical regimen, we will continue to follow her. 
She will return for a follow-up visit in approximately three
months.

[PATIENT]
MR #[MEDICALRECORD]
[DATE]
 
Ms. [PATIENT] is a [AGE]-year-old, perimenopausal woman with non-
insulin dependent diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a history
of tobacco use, who underwent a recent cardiac catheterization
for a positive stress test.  At catheterization she had a
proximal 60% lesion in her RCA as well as a mid 60-70% RCA
lesion, obtuse marginal lesion of 60%, and an LAD mid lesion of
60%.  At the time it was decided to continue medical therapy on
Ms. [PATIENT].  Since her cardiac catheterization approximately two
weeks ago, she has had no recurrent symptoms of chest pain.  She
continues on her medicines including Lopid 500 mg b.i.d.,
atenolol, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as
well as her oral hypoglycemic medicines.
 
Physical Examination:  She is an obese, white female in no acute
distress.  Her vital signs are stable.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation.  Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She has no
peripheral edema.
 
Electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70,
axis of about 46, and there are no acute ST-T changes noted.
 
Impression/Plan:  We will continue Ms. [PATIENT] on her current
cardiac regimen.  She has three-vessel coronary artery disease,
non-obstructive in nature.  As long as she remains asymptomatic
on her current medical regimen, we will continue to follow her. 
She will return for a follow-up visit in approximately three
months.

This patient was seen in combination with Dr. Lance Camacho.  His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.  She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.  This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.  She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.  She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.  She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.  She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.  She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.  She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her carotids are 2+.  Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.  Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.  There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.

ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.  After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.  She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.  She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.

EKG SB at 57bpm, Q in v1, III/AvF, left axis, TWI in v3-v6, new from previous.  QTc 430ms (manually calculated)
CXR enlarged cardiac silhouette, L basilar opacity.

Impression/Plan: 
68yoM h/o HTN/HL, schizophrenia, medication non-compliance presents s/p VF arrest, NSTEMI, AMS.  Patient likely had ischemic VT/VF.  Per outside records, the patient does not seem to have ongoing activity of his acute coronary syndrome.  His mental status continues to be poor, and is likely multifactorial; my suspicion is that he does have some level of anoxic brain injury as the dominant pathology.

NSTEMI:  npo p MN for cardiac cath in AM.  Patient not able to consent at this point, and does not have any clear family members that can do this for him.  Will follow his mental status exam.
	-aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor, heparin IV.
	-can add ACEi when he is taking po   s and if BPs need further titration.
	-mucomyst for renal prophylaxis.
	-for risk factors, check a1c.
S/P VF ARREST: likely in the setting of NSTEMI
	-cath as above.
	-nl QTc
	-s/p amio IV load.  C/w amiodarone po load.  If reversible lesion, likely can d/c.
AMS: anoxic brain injury; current somnolence likely from narcotics.
	-appreciate neurology consultation
	-head CT
	-c/w home zyprexa.  Haldol prn.
BRONCHOSPASM: does not have significant smoking history.  ? aspiration vs cardiac wheezing
	-albuterol/ipratropium nebs standing, and prn.
	-gently diurese
	-finish course of antibiotics; ceftriaxone/azithromycin until 2/12.
CHF: mild failure
	-lasix 40iv x1.  goal TBB    500-1L
	-follow creatinine, as he apparently bumped at OSH.
U/A: check urine culture
FEN: npo while somnolent.  Otherwise, low fat/chol, no added salt.  
PROPHY:  on heparin IV.
CODE: FULL (patient cannot answer for himself)
DISPO: PT, OT, SLP eval

ID/CC: [AGE]yoM h/o schizophrenia, medication non-compliance, presents s/p cardiac arrest.

History of Present Illness:  
Per [HOSPITAL] Records, the patient was admitted on [DATE] after collapsing in the mall.  His total time down is unclear, but the patient had an AED administered and he was shocked x2.  When EMTs arrived, they found the patient to be in VF w/ agonal breathing.  CPR was administered and he was shocked x3.  After the 3rd defibrillation, the patient awoke and was in NSR.  The patient could not recall any of the events.  

At [HOSPITAL], was hemodynamically stable and did not have a recurrence of malignant arrhythmia.  His EKG showed TWI v3-v6.  His troponins went from 0.01-0.27-0.34, CK 451 w/ MB 28 (full laboratory values not available).  TTE showed depressed LV function w/ EF 30%, w/ apical apical dyskinesis.  Head CT was negative for acute process.  His mental status demonstrated slowly recovering delirium.  He was found to have a pneumonia and treated with ceftriaxone/azithromycin.  His arrhythmias were treated with amiodarone IV, transitioned to po.  He was transferred to [HOSPITAL] for cardiac catheterization.

EKG SB at 57bpm, Q in v1, III/AvF, left axis, TWI in v3-v6, new from previous.  QTc 430ms (manually calculated)
CXR enlarged cardiac silhouette, L basilar opacity.

Impression/Plan: 
[AGE]yoM h/o HTN/HL, schizophrenia, medication non-compliance presents s/p VF arrest, NSTEMI, AMS.  Patient likely had ischemic VT/VF.  Per outside records, the patient does not seem to have ongoing activity of his acute coronary syndrome.  His mental status continues to be poor, and is likely multifactorial; my suspicion is that he does have some level of anoxic brain injury as the dominant pathology.

NSTEMI:  npo p MN for cardiac cath in AM.  Patient not able to consent at this point, and does not have any clear family members that can do this for him.  Will follow his mental status exam.
	-aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor, heparin IV.
	-can add ACEi when he is taking po   s and if BPs need further titration.
	-mucomyst for renal prophylaxis.
	-for risk factors, check a1c.
S/P VF ARREST: likely in the setting of NSTEMI
	-cath as above.
	-nl QTc
	-s/p amio IV load.  C/w amiodarone po load.  If reversible lesion, likely can d/c.
AMS: anoxic brain injury; current somnolence likely from narcotics.
	-appreciate neurology consultation
	-head CT
	-c/w home zyprexa.  Haldol prn.
BRONCHOSPASM: does not have significant smoking history.  ? aspiration vs cardiac wheezing
	-albuterol/ipratropium nebs standing, and prn.
	-gently diurese
	-finish course of antibiotics; ceftriaxone/azithromycin until [DATE].
CHF: mild failure
	-lasix 40iv x1.  goal TBB    500-1L
	-follow creatinine, as he apparently bumped at OSH.
U/A: check urine culture
FEN: npo while somnolent.  Otherwise, low fat/chol, no added salt.  
PROPHY:  on heparin IV.
CODE: FULL (patient cannot answer for himself)
DISPO: PT, OT, SLP eval

He was stabilized at Blakely House, then transferred to NAMC. At NAMC, patient had electrocardiac cath, which showed 3vd disease and Dr. Albright   s team was consulted. As pt was encephalopathic s/p arrest, he was transferred to Fremont Medical Center on 02/21/33, where he was rehabilitated and his mental status improved. At FMC, his diuretics were titrated (lasix 20 mg -> 40 mg), and psychiatry weighed in on his posthypoxic encephalopathy.

-Technically Difficult Study-

Sub optimal parasternal images.

MITRAL VALVE
There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus.  There is no evidence
of mitral valve prolapse.  There is no evidence of mitral regurgitation by
color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM
The left atrium is dilated.

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT
Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic
valve is tricuspid.  There is evidence of trace aortic insufficiency by color
and spectral Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE
The left ventricular cavity size is dilated.  The left ventricular systolic
function is moderately impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic
with regional variation.  The estimated ejection fraction is 35 %.

TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.
There is an insufficient tricuspid regurgitation Doppler profile to estimate
an RV systolic pressure.

RIGHT VENTRICLE
The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function
is within normal limits.

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

2/11/33 Left Heart Cath
1) Three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The Left Main is large and has only mild irregularities.  The LAD is
diffusely diseased (30 - 40%) and has a distal 80% stenosis.  The Left Cx is
totally occluded The LCx receives faint collaterals from the LAD territority.
The ramus branch has diffuse disease with a 80% proximal stenosis and a 70% mid
stenosis.  The RCA is occluded proximally and there are right to right
collaterals. There are 80% mid and 80% distal stenoses in the RCA.
2) LV gram shows EF of 30%, with anterior/apical akinesis and inferior
hypokinesis.
3) Right dominant system

RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Long:
 
Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.  I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,
2092.  Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
 
Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal
failure of unknown etiology.  She is six years status post
hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult
leiomyosarcoma was discovered.  She has an extensive history of
hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.  She had one stillborn
infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions. 
SFOC records are unavailable at this time.
 
Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,
furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,
Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex
250 mg qid.
 
On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no
distress.  Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.  Temperature
is normal.  Pulse is 88 beats per minute.  Blood pressure is
178/96.  There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.  There is a
buffalo hump.  The lungs show scattered wheezing.  Cardiovascular
exam is normal.  There are discolorations of the skin across the
neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not
raised.  The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.  There is a
ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.  The
extremities show trace edema.  There are several areas of
superficial petechiae.
 
In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of
unclear etiology.  She does report an episode of lower extremity
swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.  ThisRoberta Vincent
MR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092
 
 
raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now
in a chronic phase.  Other diagnostic possibilities include other
forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus
erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions. 
Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this
time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased
risk due to her body habitus.
 
I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.
Vincent. Although she has no medical conditions which would
preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her
obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of
hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.  I have
encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in
order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or
transplantation.  Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent
of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not
been performed previously.
 
I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her
kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to
meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV
fistula or placement of a graft.
 
Thank you once again for your kind referral.
 
Respectfully,

RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Xanthos,
 
We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in
the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093.  We will
not repeat her history as you know it well. Over the past three
months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,
occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness
and tingling of the fingers and toes. She has maintained a
relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness
of breath.  An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092
revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
 
On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
pounds.  Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.  The
lungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked
cushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent
comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
facial hair over the past several months.
 
In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of
uremia.  Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
dialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to
recheck her chemistries today.  We would also recommend that she
undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.  Although renal
failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
 
Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
 
On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
pounds.  Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.  The
lungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked
cushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. [PATIENT]
comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
facial hair over the past several months.
 
In summary, Mrs. [PATIENT] appears to be developing early symptoms of
uremia.  Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
dialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to
recheck her chemistries today.  We would also recommend that she
undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.  Although renal
failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
 
Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 59 year old female who 
presents to us with shortness of breath tonight.  She has been 
developing shortness of breath now with nausea and vomiting today. 
There is no history of fevers, no chills, and no abdominal pain. 
She does complain of some mild flank pain but nothing significant. 
She has had chronic back pain for years. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a significant past medical 
history.  History is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and 
congestive heart failure.  She is status post total abdominal 
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and status post 
L5-S1 laminectomy. 
MEDICATIONS:  The patient is on multiple medications including 
Lasix, lisinopril, prednisone, Premarin, nifedipine. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Here the patient looked mildly 
uncomfortable.  Blood pressure was 151/58, oxygen saturation was 99 
percent, and heart rate was 98.  Blood pressure has remained stable 
since she has been here.  Heent examination was normal.  Pupils 
were reactive normally bilaterally.  Oropharynx was clear.  Neck 
was mildly obese with no jugular venous distention.  There were 
good carotid upstrokes, no bruit.  Lungs had some crackles 
two-thirds of the way up and some rales at the bases, one-half way 
up.  Cardiac examination revealed S1 and S2, somewhat tachycardic, 
with a 2/6 murmur.  Abdomen had multiple striae and was soft and 
non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There were good pulses 
throughout.  Extremities were normal. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes here were normal.  Blood sugar 
was normal.  White count was 14, hematocrit 34.  Initial CK was 
140, troponin 2.6.  Chest x-ray showed moderate effusion and a 
small left effusion.  Patient's last echocardiogram showed an 
ejection fraction of 60 percent.  This echocardiogram was done in 
February of 2096.  She also had a second echocardiogram in April of 
2096 which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent, with moderate 
MR.  EKG here showed ST depression in V6 and some decreased T's in 
aVR and aVL.  Sinus rhythm on EKG rated about 100. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department the 
patient was heparinized.  She was placed on oxygen, given an 
aspirin, and placed on a Nitroglycerin drip.  She also received 
some Nitropaste here.  She also received a mg of Morphine.  SFOC 
Cardiology was aware of the patient's troponin of 2.6, indicating 
that she had a myocardial infarction or could still be evolving a 
myocardial infarction here.  She received IV Lasix 60 mg here and 
responded very well.  She was diuresing considerably and her 
shortness of breath appeared to be much better than when she 
arrived here in the Emergency Department. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure with myocardial 
infarction, diuresing well and responding to medications. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
admitted to the CCU.  SFOC is aware.  She remains in stable 
condition here and is going to be transferred up to CCU in a little 
while.  Condition at this time is satisfactory.

See primarily by Dr. Ulises Collier.  I also saw the patient and 
reviewed Dr. Collier's history. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 62 year-old woman comes from 
dial where she developed substernal chest pain radiating to her 
left arm near the end of the run.  She also complains of shortness 
of breath.  She noted some nausea, but no vomiting.  She had no 
other related symptoms.  She has had no previous history of chest 
pain.  She was given Nitroglycerin x 3 and this eventually relieved 
her pain. 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes end-stage renal disease, 
coronary artery disease with a bypass graft but without any chest 
pain at the time, and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus which may 
account for her previous cardiac history without chest pain. 
ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND CODEINE 
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin and Xanax. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 164/94, pulse 
94, respirations 24, oxygen saturation 96%.  GENERAL:  The patient 
is comfortable in no acute distress.  HEAD AND NECK: 
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal and reactive. Pharynx 
benign.  Tongue is of normal shape and contour.  Neck is supple. 
No jugular venous distention.  LUNGS:  Are clear bilaterally. 
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2, with no murmurs, rubs 
or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender with normal bowel 
sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema or rash. 
NEUROLOGICAL:  Patient is alert and oriented x 3.  She moves all 
extremities.  Has symmetrical strength and all proximal and distal 
upper and lower motor bilaterally.  Normal sensation to light touch 
grossly. 
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 9, hematocrit 41.  Glucose was 
high at 533.  However, she has bicarbonate of 24, so she is 
probably not in diabetic ketoacidosis.  BUN 31, creatinine 3.8. 
Troponin-I was 0.5.  Chest x-ray was negative.  Electrocardiogram 
shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and 
non-specific ST/T wave changes.  Perhaps some ST depressions in II, 
III and AVF, and deep S waves in V1, 2, 3, and 4. 
TREATMENT RENDERED AND COURSE IN ED: In the hospital the patient 
did not have further chest pain here.  She was admitted for chest 
pain and for rule out myocardial infarction to the Medical Service. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out myocardial infarction 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admitted.

                                              1-29-62
 
 
 
History of Present Illness: This was the first Internal Medicine clinic visit for 
this 38-year-old black male with a history of non-insulin dependent 
diabetes diagnosed a year ago, maintained on Diabeta 5 mg. q.d.  Also 
with a history of borderline hypertension previously on 
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d. for the last year, which he discontinued 
last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks 
he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and 
he is afraid that his sugar is up.  He states that over the last two or 
three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light 
followed by mild headaches.  He says that the visual changes are usually 
accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with 
Excedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.  He does admit to a history of 
migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more 
severe than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous 
migraine aura.  
 
He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time 
they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come 
to this appointment at this time.  He denies any fevers.  He does have a 
recent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a 
night over the last three weeks.  He also has been complaining of 
diarrhea two or three times a week over the last two to three weeks, 
which is watery in nature without any blood.  He has no nausea or 
vomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like 
this in the past.  His past medical history is otherwise benign.  
 
Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
frequently.  He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.  
He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.  He is sexually 
active with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.
 
Family History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with 
diabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with 
history of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.  
His oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is 
alive and well without any medical problems. 
 
Physical Examination;  He is a mildly obese black male in no acute 
distress with weight of 270 lbs.  Blood pressure 138/88 in the right arm 
and 132/94 in the left arm.  Pulse regular at about 80.  HEENT was 
notable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or 
hypertensive retinopathy.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had no thyromegaly.  
His chest was clear.  His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his 
                                              1-29-62
 
 
 
heart sounds were normal.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, 
without any hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally 
descended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace 
heme positive stool.  Neurologic exam was intact. 
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased 
     sugar at this time.  Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow 
     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta 
     to 10 mg. q.d.  He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet 
     control as well.  
2.   Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.  I 
     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it 
     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt 
     diet.  
3.   Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.  I will get a 
     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to 
     three weeks, and follow it at this time.
4.   Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this 
     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result 
     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this 
     time.

vomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like 
this in the past.  His past medical history is otherwise benign.  
 
Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
frequently.  He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.  
He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.  He is sexually 
active with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.
 
Family History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with 
diabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with 
history of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.  
His oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is 
alive and well without any medical problems. 
 
Physical Examination;  He is a mildly obese black male in no acute 
distress with weight of 270 lbs.  Blood pressure 138/88 in the right arm 
and 132/94 in the left arm.  Pulse regular at about 80.  HEENT was 
notable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or 
hypertensive retinopathy.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had no thyromegaly.  
His chest was clear.  His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his 
                                              [DATE]
 
 
 
heart sounds were normal.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, 
without any hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally 
descended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace 
heme positive stool.  Neurologic exam was intact. 
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased 
     sugar at this time.  Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow 
     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta 
     to 10 mg. q.d.  He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet 
     control as well.  
2.   Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.  I 
     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it 
     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt 
     diet.  
3.   Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.  I will get a 
     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to 
     three weeks, and follow it at this time.
4.   Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this 
     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result 
     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this 
     time.

HPI:  The patient is a 41 year old man with a history of non-insulin 
dependent diabetes, hypertension, obesity and substance abuse who I 
learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is 
presenting for follow up of his DVT.  The patient's current medical 
problems include:
1.   Recent DVT.  The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 
     1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.  
     The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any 
     previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long 
     car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as 
     previously over the recent few weeks.  The patient stated he awoke 
     in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right 
     quadriceps and right calf.  He later developed progressive swelling 
     of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency 
     department.  He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which 
     confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.  He was 
     admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.  
     The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the 
     time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was 
     sent off which was negative.  The patient currently returns to me 
     complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.  He states that 
     he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not 
     occur during his hospital course.  The patient was also angry and 
     upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.  I 
     explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of 
     his emergency department visit.  I called all of the parties 
     responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had 
     occurred.
 
2.   Hypertension.  The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives 
     including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE 
     inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were 
     discontinued recently.  With a discontinuation of his drinking, the 
     patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.
 
3.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  I recently started the patient on 
     insulin.  He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately 
     did not make his visit.  His insulin dose was adjusted during his 
     recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in 
     the morning and 15 units of regular.  In the evening he takes 10 
     units of NPH and 10 units of regular.  The patient does not yet have 
     a home glucometer.  We will arrange for this.

                                              2-4-65
 
 
 
Physical Examination:  Vital signs showed a heart rate of 90.  Blood 
pressure: 135/92. Respiratory rate: 14 and unlabored.  HEENT: pupils 
equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, 
oropharynx clear. Mucous membranes moist. Cardiac: regular rate and 
rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs: clear to 
ausculation. Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds.  
Extremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with 
significant pain and a positive Homan's sign.  
 
Impression:
1)   DVT.  Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT 
     check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT.  I 
     encouraged the patient to elevate the leg. My feeling is that the DVT 
     has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not 
     therapeutic at the present time.  I have arranged for the patient to 
     follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat 
     check of his PT.  I left instructions that I should be called 
     immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the 
     patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a 
     cane to help with ambulation. 
 
2)   Adult onset diabetes.  I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his 
     next office visit.  A finger stick in the office approximately three 
     hours after eating is 253.  I feel this is still too elevated.  I 
     will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.  I 
     will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary 
     adjustments in his medications at that time.

HPI:  The patient is a 43 year old man with multiple medical problems 
who presents for routine follow up.
 
CURRENT ISSUES:
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.  We discussed 
     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
     tighter control.  He states he has been following his finger 
     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this. His 
     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
     regular.  At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
     regular at dinnertime.  He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
     rash to his simvastatin.  This resolved on the discontinuation of 
     the simvastatin.  Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
     January, 2067.  He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
     fats.
3.   Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.  The 
     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
     Jobst stocking.  He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is 
     compliant with the stocking.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.  Heart rate:  76.  
Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and 
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds.  
Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 1+ pedal edema of 
the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.  Foot 
care remains excellent.
 
IMPRESSION:                         
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  We will increase the patient's 
     morning NPH dose to 40 units.  He will once again try to become 
     more compliant with his diet.  He will be scheduled for a follow up 
     ophthalmologic examination.
2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  We will hold off re-starting therapy given 
     his recent rash to simvastin.  We will re-check a fasting lipid 
     profile as well as a set of LFT's.

3.   General health maintenance.  We will once again schedule a follow

     He will keep a log of his sugars and follow up with me in the 
     clinic in approximately one to two months.

Speciailists: Carroll (Cardiology)Chief Complaint Abnormal stress testHistory of Present Illness 55yo M with a history of IDDM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ESRD (on HD), h/o DVT (positive lupus anticoagulant), osteoarthritis was scheduled for elective hip surgery 3/29/77. For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible. As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27. Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy. On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
 
The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed. After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter. He was also given Warfarin 8mg PO x 1 for an INR of 1.6.Review of Systems negative except as abovePast Medical History 1. IDDM (A1c 6.9, neuropathy)

Speciailists: [DOCTOR] (Cardiology)Chief Complaint Abnormal stress testHistory of Present Illness [AGE]yo M with a history of IDDM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ESRD (on HD), h/o DVT (positive lupus anticoagulant), osteoarthritis was scheduled for elective hip surgery [DATE]. For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on [DATE] that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible. As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. [DOCTOR] who saw the patient in clinic on [DATE]. Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy. On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
 
The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed. After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter. He was also given Warfarin 8mg PO x 1 for an INR of 1.6.Review of Systems negative except as abovePast Medical History 1. IDDM (A1c 6.9, neuropathy)

EDVISIT^46103196^HART, MATTHEW^06/14/79^NAPOLITANO, URSULA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old male

with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,

history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and

DVT on Coumadin who comes in to the ER because he has recently

missed dialysis appointment and he feels increased abdominal

girth and shortness of breath.  He said that his father has been

sick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time

helping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday

and missed his Friday dialysis run.  Today is Sunday and he

generally gets dialysis on Sunday as well.  When I asked if he

has been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,

but he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and

was not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the

pain.  Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain

when he was exerting himself.  He does feel slightly increased

shortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks

that because of increased fluids.  He has had no fevers or

chills, no lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,

coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis,

diabetes, DVT on Coumadin, hypertension, bladder cancer,

substance abuse and GERD.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  AV fistula in 01/2078.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, rare alcohol and occasional cocaine

use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer and prostate cancer.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned in HPI, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed, please see the list.

ALLERGIES:  Include cephalosporin and simvastatin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, heart rate 92,

respiratory rate 28, blood pressure 155/84 and O2 saturation 100%

on room air.  The patient is awake, alert, talking in complete

sentences, appears to be mildly uncomfortable.  ENT:  Atraumatic.

 Neck:  Normal to inspection, supple.  Chest:  Clear to

auscultation bilaterally, no rales.  Cardiovascular:  Regular

rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Minimal

distention, soft.  No focal tenderness.  Skin is intact. 

Extremities:  No lower extremity swelling or edema, no calf

tenderness bilaterally.  Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Cranial

nerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or sensory

deficits.  Gait is normal.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received an EKG, which

showed normal sinus rhythm.  No significant ST or T

abnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with

his previous EKG.  PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of

acute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.  Only labs which resulted

initially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets

423,000 and white count of 6.74.  We made contact with the renal

fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the

dialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this

patient.  His potassium was not back at the time that he left the

department, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias

on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is

very atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess

when he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure

that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.  After he

left the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1

and a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a

chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,

glucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium

8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called

the renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have

the patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to

treat him there acutely.  Again after the dialysis, the patient

will return to the Emergency Department.  We will reassess if

symptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes. 

If he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no

chest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for

acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not

acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he

will be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis

schedule.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Volume overload.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.

DISPOSITION:  Pending.

Please see ED note for further ED course.  This was a shared

visit with resident physician, Dr. Adam Mcclure.

See NP note for full details. Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week. The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain. He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder. No fevers/chills. Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

Neurologic exam: A & O x3, CN 2-12 intact, motor 5/5 all ext, sensation intact to light touch throughout, nl gait, normal finger-to-nose bilaterally, neg pronator drift. Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.

Medical Decision Making ED Course

75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED. The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance. Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well. Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications). Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week. Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

Record date: 2151-01-25

 January 25, 2151 (initial office note) Frank Caldwell:
	He is a 75 year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas. He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers    6 or 7 weeks ago. Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on. This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein. He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions. A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion. Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma. The mass itself is about 2   cm in diameter.
	His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.
	He denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week.
	His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131, cholecystectomy in 2131, prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143.
	His current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6     7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin.
	He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related).
	His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis. He has had some mild recent weight loss. He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
	I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time. With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation. He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy. I   ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter. After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT. He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us. This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up. I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.

Record date: [DATE]

 [DATE] (initial office note) [PATIENT]:
	He is a [AGE] year old man who is referred by Dr. [DOCTOR] of [HOSPITAL] for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas. He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers    6 or 7 weeks ago. Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on. This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein. He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions. A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion. Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma. The mass itself is about 2   cm in diameter.
	His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.
	He denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week.
	His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in [DATE], cholecystectomy in [DATE], prostatectomy for cancer in [DATE] and resection of a lung cancer in [DATE].
	His current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6     7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin.
	He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related).
	His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis. He has had some mild recent weight loss. He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
	I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time. With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation. He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy. I   ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter. After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the [HOSPITAL] for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT. He comes from [CITY] and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the [HOSPITAL] in coordination with us. This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up. I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.
	I spent 45 minutes in consultation and coordination of care.

	Reason for visit:

   chest pain, with known LCX lesion admit for cardiac cath in am.



	Interval History:

   75 yr old male who is admitted with new onset chest pain. Pt has a hx of significant   AAA  repair in '31and newly diagnosed nonoperable pancreatic cancer. During evaluation of pancreatic cancer, CT revealed pseudoaneurysm of aortic graft. Before start of chemotherapy, pt underwent surgical repair of pseudoaneurysm. 

2/16/51 Pt had successful surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm, complicated by a intraoperative NSTEMI with a peak troponin of .36. 

2/20/51 echo done showing EF of 70%.

2/22/51 cath revealing LM normal, LAD 40% stenosis after D1, 95% stenosis at ostium of D1 and LCX 80% at the takeoff of OM2 with 70%ostial OM2 lesion, and RCA non-dominant with no significant disease.

Because pt was not having any symptoms of angina, the decision was made not to intervene on the LCX lesion and to stress the pt at a later date.

Currently pt is to begin treatment of his pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy and radiation.  Today pt was to have his first treatment, but starting having chest pain and was sent to the ER for further evaluation. 

Recently for the past three days, pt reports on and off chest pain lasting 4-5 hours with raidation to jaw and left arm at rest and excertion. No assciated symptoms of SOB or diaphoresis. Pt thought he was having heartburn symptoms.

In the ER, EKG showed mild lateral ST depression in V5-V6, initial troponin neg and chest pain relieved with one SL nitrogylcerin. Heparin started and pt transferred pain free to Cardiology.   Upon arrival, pt had one episode of chest pain, EKG showed no acute changes, chest pain relieved with one SL nitrogylcerin.

RE: URQUHART, WENDELL Y
MRN: 5747359
DOB: 11/22/2072


Dear Dr. Overman: 
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Wendell Urquhart, in consultation today. The patient presents complaining of lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation. He develop symptoms gradually three months ago with no history of preceding trauma. The symptoms became progressively worse. The patient has a history of lower back injury 30 years ago in a motor vehicle accident - at that time he was diagnosed with disc rupture. Currently the pain is intermittent and occurs daily. He grades the intensity of the pain as up to 7 to 8 out of 10 on the numerical pain scale. He describes it as sharp shooting sensation in the lower back with radiation all the way down right lower extremity to the foot. The symptoms are worse with standing; better with sitting and lying down. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with coughing or sneezing. The patient any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control. He describes occasional intermittent numbness in the right leg and foot. He denies any weakness. He lost 30 pounds through dieting over the past two months. The pain does not wake the patient up at night. 
Diagnostically, the patient denies any recent imaging studies of the lumbar spine. 


Therapeutically, the patient denies any recent physical therapy; no previous injections or surgical procedures of the lumbar spine. Currently he takes nabumetone 750 mg once in the morning with moderate relief of his symptoms. He also occasionally takes Naproxen at night with moderate relief. 
MEDICATIONS: 
1. Aspirin. 
2. Hydrochlorothiazide. 
3. Toprol. 
4. Caduet. 
5. Nabumetone as needed. 
6. Naproxen as needed. 
ALLERGIES: Penicillin. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
1. Coronary artery disease status post 2 stent placements. 
2. Hypertension. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 
1. Cardiac stent placement. 
2. Left total hip replacement. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works as a programmer for Dish Network. He is married with no children. He does not smoke, drinks alcohol socially, and denies illicit drug use. 
FAMILY HISTORY: There is no history of medical problems that run in the family. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The complete review of systems was performed including constitutional, eyes, ENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, integument, neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, lymphatic, and immunologic. It is positive for musculoskeletal complains and medical problems as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is well-developed, moderately overweight man in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented to time, person and place. His mood and affect are stable. He demonstrates good attention and concentration. The patient ambulates without an assistive device with normal heel strike and toe off.  He is able to stand on his heels and toes. He is able to walk heel to toe in a straight line with intact balance. Vital signs are stable. Sclera is anicteric, no ptosis noted, no lymphadenopathy, unlabored respiration, abdomen is soft and non-tender, no skin rash.  


There is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 60 degrees, extension limited to 10 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over the spinous processes, paraspinal muscles, SI joints or greater trochanteric bursae bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally.  1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally. There is no pain with hip internal and external rotation. 



Cervical range of motion is within normal limit. There is no tenderness to palpation over cervical spinous processes and paraspinal muscles. There is full 5/5 strength in the upper extremities with intact sensation bilaterally. Symmetrical reflexes in the biceps, brachioradialis and triceps bilaterally. Negative Hoffmans sign and Spurlings maneuver.  The range of motion in bilateral upper extremities is normal. 
IMAGING: During today's visit I reviewed x-ray study of the pelvis dated September 24 2132. it demonstrates lumbosacral spondylosis in the visualized lumbosacral spine. 
For complete description of the study, please see formal radiology report. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Sub-acute lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation, non-focal neurological examination. 
2. Lumbar radiculitis. 
3. Degenerative disc disease. 
4. Lumbar spondylosis. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. MRI study of the lumbar spine will be obtained to further evaluate etiology of ongoing symptoms. The patient will discuss with radiologist if MRI study can not be performed due to cardiac stents. 
2. Upon review of the imaging studies, a lumbar epidural steroid injection would be considered to decrease the inflammatory component of his symptoms and to inhibit peripheral nociceptive transmission. 
3. The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises to prevent deconditioning. He was encouraged to continue with weight loss program. 
4. The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. He will be seen in follow-up after imaging study is completed in 1-2 weeks. 



Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient. Please do not hesitate to call my office for any further questions. 


Sincerely,

EDVISIT^72484104^URQUHART, WENDELL^02/15/34^MARQUEZ, RONALD

I evaluated this patient independently.  I concur with findings

as noted on the medical record, supervised the care as provided

by the resident in the Emergency Department.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 61-year-old male

with complaint of chest discomfort on exertion for the past six

weeks after climbing upstairs.  The patient noticed symptoms

again today.  He called his FLH physician who sent him to the

Emergency Department for probable admission.  The patient has had

a prior history of proximal RCA lesion and two stents placed in

06/2128 after similar episodes.  The patient has been doing well

since and recently has developed worsening symptoms.  He is

followed by Dr. Ure and contacted Dr. Ure's office who

sent him to the Emergency Department.  He denies chest pain at

rest.  He does not have abdominal pain.  No pain radiating to the

back.  No shortness of breath, dysuria, or additional symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension and coronary artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As noted, past surgical history is stent

placement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past tobacco user.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for that which is noted on the

HPI.  All other symptoms are negative as noted in the medical

record.

MEDICATIONS:  Please refer to the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs are as noted in the medical

record.  I examined this patient and agree with physical exam

findings as noted on the record.  Please refer to the chart.  Of

note, the patient has no specific physical exam findings, a

benign physical examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pending.  EKG is normal sinus rhythm with

biphasic T waves in III, V6 but otherwise normal, no acute ST-T

wave changes.  The patient is currently pain free.

ASSESSMENT AND MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  This is a 61-year-old

male with likely stable angina that is worsening in character. 

He will be admitted to Cardiology.  I discussed this case with

the cardiologist on call, Dr. Maxwell.  The patient will be

admitted for further workup and determination of catheterization

if necessary.

Dear Dr. Nunes:
 
Thank you for asking me to see Mr. Craft. Patient says he was diagnosed 
as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker 
Xian and was treated with steroids at the time. It's not clear what CNS 
or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. Because of complex 
partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who 
referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his 
estradiol level was in the 80s. His testosterone was up but available 
testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he 
said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. Said he was doing 
fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. He 
said his neck felt full and warm. His head felt like it was going to 
explode. He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was 
vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't 
right. Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and 
postnasal drip. Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and 
anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any 
other results). He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis 
on his legs. No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth 
or gum except that he has to wear his glasses. Recently had some teeth 
removed. Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. No other 
cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension. No GI 
problems. Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to 
benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR. Dr. Nunes

A PSA has been normal. Past history of kidney stones. He's allergic to 
penicillin, Lozol, allopurinol and bee venom. Has a past history of 
diagnosis of gout versus pseudogout. Sleeps fine. No history of fractures. 
Only operation is a total knee replacement on the left for arthritis and 
appendectomy. Bruises easily, frequently has headaches. Has been diagnosed 
as being bipolar. Exercises.
 
Recent MRI consistent with a ""vasculopathy.""
 
Family history. Mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. Father died 
at 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also 
smoked. He is an only child.
 
Social history. Doesn't smoke. When he's depressed he becomes a binge 
drinker. Exercises when he's not depressed. He's retired since 2103. Was 
a stage manager.
 
Physical exam. Somewhat overweight gentleman. Blood pressure was 160/80. 
Pulse was 88 and regular. Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on 
forearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. One 
small node in the left side of his neck. Mouth and throat was clear. 
Bilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. Ear drums fine. 
Hearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the 
forehead). Chest clear. No CVA tenderness. Heart: No murmurs. Abdomen, 
no organs, masses, tenderness but obese. Extremity, joint exam fine. 
Neurological fine.
 
I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current 
symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection. 
However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to 
also exclude lupus and vasculitis. Basically I told him to take Flonase 
twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip 
cleared up. 
 
In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a 
stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the 
testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of 
testosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease 
estradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding 
hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain. Patient 
also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments 
regarding increased appetite, decreased memory,

decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased 
hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of 
cholinergic transmission problems.
 
Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking 
Aricept to improve his memory. Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it 
for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted. 
 
Thank you again for asking me to see him. Please let me know if I can be 
of further assistance.

PS: If you could give me some information of what evidence there was 
that he had systemic lupus and neuropsychiatric lupus back in 2103 at 
the Vermilion Hospital, for instance the discharge summary from the Vermilion Hospital, that would be appreciated.

RE:Craft, Lloyd
MRN:26649180
 
Dear Dr. Short:
 
Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr. Craft for the 
possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.  As you know, he 
is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical 
history for a rheumatological disease.  His past medical history, 
briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that 
time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and 
he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-
stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.  
All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.  He was 
treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his 
symptoms and seizures went away.  Since that time, he has had a 
recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
neck, pressure within his head.  He considers himself to have 
vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, 
numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive 
salivation and increased appetite. In describing his headache, he 
noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
quality.  It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.  There is no 
family history of migraines as well.  Also during his headache 
events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any 
nausea or vomiting.
 
Past medical history:  As per above.  Medicval issues include 
bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic 
gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of 
migraine headaches.  
 
His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, 
chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n. and 
prednisone p.r.n.  
 
He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.  
There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
remission.

Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus in father and father also had heart disease.  
 
Social history:  He is a former stage manager.  
 
Neurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.  Attention 
was normal.  Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic 
errors.  There is no memory deficit or agnosia.  The patient gave 
a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental 
status testing was performed.  Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual 
fields were full.  Disks were sharp.  Fundus was clear.  
Extraocular movements were intact.  There was no nystagmus.  He 
had normal facial sensation and symmetry.  Hearing was grossly 
normal.  Uvula, tongue and palate were midline.  Motor examination 
revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.  Deep tendon 
reflexes were symmetrical.  There was no upper motor neuron sign.  
Coordination and gait were normal.  
 
Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history 
of lupus in the past.  His recent blood work shows that his 
double-stranded DNA was negative.  Taking into consideration his 
current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular 
disease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of 
central nervous system vasculitis.  He was told that he is at a 
high risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood 
pressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol.  If it is 
possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start 
a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and 
also consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d. for primary prevention 
of heart disease.  He was informed that it is possible that there 
is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his 
hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his 
symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is 
not clear.  
 
Thank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare.

Assessment/Recommendations:

[AGE] y.o. male with obesity, BMI = 35 -> 32/33, with known complications as listed above.  Causes of this patient's obesity include genetic predisposition, past medications (prednisone, antidepressants?), emotional/compulsive/binge-like eating related to manic phase of bipolar illness.   



Pt continuing comprehensive program of individualized nutritional education addressing meal structuring, portion control, food choices, etc. and psychological counseling addressing emotional contributors to eating and weight gain.  Seeing [DOCTOR] RD, and [DOCTOR], PhD.  Lost 18# in 4 months (1 pound a week) so far with nutritional change, exercise.  Commended pt on success.



Pt will continue exercise (walks 4 mi/d, gym 2 (going to 3) times a week for an hour, swimming).



Because of the afternoon period he describes as being like a ""Warewolf"" (4-7 pm), I recommended he use this time for exercise rather than for his other, more sedentary, activities.



At a later time we can consider medication (in this case, orlistat).  Currently progress is excellent without needing it.



Discuss elevated BP with PCP, may need higher dose of ACEI.



F/U w/ me 2 - 2.5 mos.



>50% of the 30-minute visit was spent counseling the patient about the potential implications of obesity and obesity-related conditions, and the above treatment plan.  All questions answered.

Neurology Attending Staff:


July 8, 2122
Time of exam 1:05 PM
Patient: Lloyd Coleman
Reason for admission: headache, gait instability, mental slowness


I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Craft who has been admitted to the Neurology service for evaluation and management.  Along with the Neurology Residents, I personally interviewed, examined, and counseled the patient, confirmed the history and findings, reviewed records and studies, and discussed the impression and recommendations.  For greater details of H/P/ROS/meds/exam/labs/studies, and assessment &amp; plan, please refer to the neurology resident admit note by Dr. Robert Neil (and below under my assessment). 


ROS performed across 10 systems are negative (as noted in neurology note) except as noted in Hx/Assessment and resident's note. 


Cognitive and Elemental neurologic exam as noted in neurology resident note. 
Of note, AFVSS, was asleep but awoke to voice and became alert, attentive to examiner, but had moderate psychomotor retardation. Was slowly conversant and followed simple multiple step commands across midline. 
Oriented to time/date/place. 
Great d/w simple attention (MOY backwards only to Nov, skipped Oct went to September and then went forwards again). 
Able to perform complex attention and working memory bihemispheric Newberry location alpha-numeric task after a second trial. 
Language: fluent w/o dysarthria. Farily Intact naming for high and low frequency items except clasp and had some mild retrieval d/w. 
Memory: gives good details of recent events including hospitalizations. 
Leprosarium name and address: 5/5 registration --&gt; 2/5 recall in 5 min --&gt; 1/3 recognition from a list
Presidential candidates = Xayarath and Golden
Calculations: # of quarters in $6.75 = 27
Moderate d/w Luria fist-side-palm that improved w/ verbal cuing but still poor L&gt;R. 
No EDSS, neglect, R-L confusion or apraxia. 
Mood: ""low ... my daughter has cancer that spread to the bones""; Affect: congruent. 


CN's II-XII intact, good up and down gaze and w/o IV or VI CN palsy. 
No PND, abnl movements, tremor, asterixis, or UE ataxia. Slow but okay FFM, FNF, RAM. 
Full MS, nl DTR's and tone. Plantar responses flexor. 
Mildly diminished stocking distributaion of LT/Cold/VS both legs to mid-shins. HKS mild d/w. 
Unable to stand w/ feet together even w/ eyes open. Moderate retropulsion trying to stand and moderate to severe retropulsion w/o spontaneously recovery on pull-test. Narraw base, small step size w/ low steppage, cautious and w/ retropulsion, slow rate w/ 10 step en bloc turning w/ imbalance (backwards). 
No photo- or phono-phobia, no nuchal rigidity.


Labs/Studies: of note BUN 21, Cr 1.2, MCV 95, Hct 41.6, wbc 13.3


Neuroimaging: Personally reviewed HCT - mildly large vents, no s/o SDH or SAH or infarct/mass lx/hemorrhage. 


Assessment:: Likely Communicating Hydrocephalus with mild elevation of ICP in context of minor head trauma.  On exam shows psychomotor retardation, d/w concentration, retrieval (including memory and words), frontal fucntions including set-switching on Lurias, and working memory. He also has moderate retropulsion on exam worse on pull-test than spontaneously, and hypomimia. His vents are mildly dilated in context of general cerebral atrophy that is not o/w out-of-proportion for his advanced age. Onset of his sx's including bilateral headache described as constant 6-8/10 pressure at posterior vertex w/ occ. radiation foward made worse by lying down for some time (worse in the mornings) and better in the afternoons or after sitting or standing. No blurred vision but mild nausea w/o vomiting. No nuchal rigidity or photo-phonophobia. No f/c/ns/cp/sob/rash/weakness/changes in sensation. Describes very clear psychomotor retardation since first fall including d/w concentraion, memory and word retrieval, and extreme slowness in mental processing (including reading - used to be a speed reader and now reads one word at a time very slowly). He's had some urinary urgency but no incontinencey. Describes his d/w gait as not being able to get his legs to do what he wants them to do despite having good strength. Additionally, feels that he's always losing his balance backwards. No suggestion of meningoencephalitis, stroke or seizure. Had mild bilat tinnitus but no vertigo. Does ascribe rare very transient visual distortion and object movement (up/down). WBC mildly elevated but no fever and U/A and CXR are negative. 


Overall, there is a diad of gait apraxia and frontal cognitive dysfunction and psychomotor retardation (no urinary incontinence) in context of sx's of mildly elevated ICP and mildly enlarged vents. Has a mild small and large fiber distal symmetric polyneuropathy which exacerbates his gait difficulties. He is also at least mildly anxious and moderately anxious.  Had bradycardia in ED - now better but need to follow. 


Plan: 

- Optimize pain/headache control
- Neuro checks q4hrs
- Cardiac telemetry
- Elevated ICP (mild) precautions with HOB &gt; 45 degrees; and gentle hydration (he is dehydrated by labs)
- MRI of brain to better assess vents and possible transependymal flow, as well as to exclude much less likely brainstem and posterior fossa lesions. Also need to assess posterior circulation w/ MRA (had mild constant tinnutus), and assess for small SDH (b/o h/o head trauma). 
- check B12, homocysteine, TSH, ESR, hsCRP, ANA

- After Brain MRI is reviewed, need to assess fundi, gait and cognition (formally score and time) and then perform diagnostic LP for hydrocephalus -- measuring opening and closing pressure after removing ~ 20cc and sending for cell count, glucose, TP, and xanthochromia as well as keeping ~ 10 cc. 

- Hold sotalol, complete cardiac/MI r/o by enzymes. 
- Follow wbc and monitor for s/s infection. 


Discussed assessment and plan with pt and family who understand and agree.

History of present illness   This is a 54-year-old white male here complaining persistent cough.  He has had a dry cough for about two months.  He was put on inhalers, but there was no improvement.  The cough is worse at night, but also he has it during the day.  He has no mucus production, no hemoptysis, no shortness of breath, and no wheezing.  He is a nonsmoker.  About a week ago, he was admitted to a local emergency room for chest pain.  He was rushed to Ochiltree General because of ST-T wave abnormalities on his EKG.  In retrospect, he has had these changes for many years, and anyway he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed mild obstruction of some of his coronary systems but no evidence of coronary artery syndrome.  He did have cardiomyopathy with the ejection fraction of 35%.  He was sent home on Toprol XL 50 mg QD, Lipitor 10 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg once a day, and Avandia 2 mg once a day.  Since returning home, the patient feels no chest pain or shortness of breath.  No orthopnea or PND.  He still has a dry cough.

	CARDIOLOGY
	

	OCHILTREE GENERAL HOSPITAL
	


	Reason for visit:
   The patient is a 61 yo Equadorian male admitted for cardiac cath after an episode of chest pain with? positive markers.


	Interval History:
   The  patient was  transferred to OGH in 3/2067 because of chest pain with positive markers and aaaanterolateral T wave changes.At which time he was diagnosed with possible ETOH myocarditis. His EF was 34%. He underwent cardiac cath which showed that the Left Main and LAD were patent, , a very distal LCX lesion. RCA was dominant and patent. The patient was discharged to home on a program of ace, BB, ASA and instructed to curtail his ETOH use. His EF improved to 66 %. He had repeat nuclear stress testing which showed small anterior infarct/small prior inferior infarct and was negative for ischemia in July 2068..
   Since then he has had a stable angina pattern with chest pain brought on when he has to move very heavy objects in his work as a packager . This is usually relieved with one TNG. Most recently, he was seen by his PC Dr. Thomson and treated with Augmentin/Robitussin AC for a URI. He had a productive cough  and some chest discomfort related to coughing. 
   Most recently, he was brought into police custody for public intoxication. While in his jail cell,""resting"" he developed the sudden onset on midsternal sharp chest pain accompanied by heavy breathing. There was no radiation to the arms, but he noted bilateral hand numbness. He also had palpitations and sweating and felt nauseated. He received one sl TNG. An ambulance was called and he received 2 TNG sprays. His pain diminished. His BP was 176/100 at the time. He was brought to the Evanston Hospital ER and found to have ""high lateral changes"" on his EKG's. Troponins were slightly elevated at .13- considered a ""gray zone"" for the hospitals range  for MI. The patient was pain free after a dose of Morphine. While in the hospital, he was placed on suicide watch. He has a history of a suicide attempt 3 years ago and has previously had counseling and been on antidepressants. He has a son who is in a vegetative state after an MVA whom he helps care for and this is very stressful. His recent arrest made hiite despondent. At Evanston Hospital, he was started on a beta blocker and Lovenox. He had a suboptimal stress test which was stopped because of SSCP and nausea. He is now transferred to OGH for further evaluation.


	Past medical history:
   diabetes
Cardiomyopathy(?ETOH related)
CAD- 50 % LCX lesion 3/67
Depression with suicide attempt 3 years ago- was on antidepressants until 6 months ago

Last echo 12 /67  EF 63%  walls 12/8 mild MR, symmetrical LVH, trace PI, RVSP 41 borderline RVH
Nuclear cardiology 7/68: small prior ant infarct/inf. infarct- no ischemia, EF nl


	Assessment and plan:
   The patient is a 47 yo diabetic, with known CAD, improved EF after d/c of ETOH now admitted after episode of chest pain with ? EKG changes and  ""intermediate""Troponins per local hospital assay.Case reviewed with Dr. Levine. Would continue ASA, beta Blocker and Lisinopril in addition to usual meds. He has previous CAD and is diabetic. Even though stess test was suboptimal, he has risk factors of diabetes, obesity and hypertension, and 50 % LCX lesion , so would proceed with cath tomorrow. NPO after midnight for cath lab. He is currently pain free so no heparin for now. Would check serial EKG;s, and troponins in addition to usual labs. Please obtain fasting cholesterol panel.

Will need psychiatric consult to aseess suicidality though he currently denies this.

Agree hold NSAIDs/Voltaren intil after cath.

	WILLOW GARDEN CARE CENTER
	

	
	Note: There is an addendum for this note (6/10/2097)
		


	Reason for visit:
   Mr. Bell is an 81 year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.


	Interval History:
   He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to April 2097. At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD. He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease. 

He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer. His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch. He required re-exploration for bleeding. He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone. His IABP was removed a few days post operatively. He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%. 

He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV. The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD. He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents. 

His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. He was followed by Dr. Hardin. His HIT assay was borderline negative. He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux. A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20. 

He was discharged from rehab on June 5th. On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA. His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half. He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath.

	Assessment and plan:
   CM/CAD - with recent CABG and coronary stenting, now admitted via the EW with dyspnea and hypoxia. Initial cardiac enzyme screen is negative, but BNP markedly elevated. Based on exam, suspect a combination of CHF and pleural effusions (diuretic medication was not being taken at prescribed dose accidentally). Will admit for diuresis, if significant effusion not improving with diuretics, may need thoracentesis. If BP allows, will resume low dose ACEI tomorrow. Check echocardiogram to assess EF and pericardial effusion. continue aspirin and Plavix. 

Recent DVT - on Fondaparinux - please continue and ask Dr. Hardin to see while in-patient (known to him). 

DM - continue current regimen, follow and cover as needed.

	Reason for visit:
   Mr. [PATIENT] is an [AGE] year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.


	Interval History:
   He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to [DATE]. At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD. He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease. 

He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. [DOCTOR]. His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch. He required re-exploration for bleeding. He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone. His IABP was removed a few days post operatively. He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%. 

He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV. The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD. He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents. 

His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. He was followed by Dr. [DOCTOR]. His HIT assay was borderline negative. He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux. A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20. 

He was discharged from rehab on [DATE]. On [DATE] he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA. His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half. He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath. His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid. However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%. 911 was called and he was brought to [HOSPITAL] ED for evaluation.
